1 | 上 | うえ | Above | Up\n Over | When a vocab word is a single kanji and alone, it tends to steal the meaning from the kanji. Same goes for this one too. It means above or up. \n When a vocab word is a single kanji and doesn't have okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually will use the kun'yomi. Since you learned the on'yomi reading of the kanji, we'll need to use a mnemonic to learn the reading of this vocabulary word.\nAbove you is a huge weight. You're holding it up and struggling (it's heavy!). You look up and try to crane your neck to see how much it weighs (うえ), but you can't see the numbers on the side of it. How long can you hold it above your head like this?
2 | 大人 | おとな | Adult | Mature | This kanji combines big and person. If you're a child, how do you think of adults? You just think of them like big people. That's why this combination of kanji means adult, and when used like an adjective, it means mature. \n Sometimes kanji have exceptional readings that are neither on’yomi, nor kun’yomi, and this is one of them. So here’s a mnemonic to help you remember this reading:\n"I'm an adult, which means I have adult responsibilities, like… oh, toner (おとな)!" Are you an adult with your own toner printer? Ohhhh, toner…
3 | 一人 | ひとり | Alone | One Person | When there's one person, what are they? Well, they're either just going to be simply one person or alone. \n The reading for this vocab doesn't follow any rules you learned previously. It's an exception, which means you have to learn the reading separately too. Spend a few moments trying to remember this word, look away for 10 seconds, and then try to recall its reading. Could you do it? Try again, this time in thirty seconds. Did you do it again? Okay, go ahead and move on. You may know it now, though you'll need to recall it again in the next 5-10 minutes if you want to remember it for good.\nAlternatively, if you know the reading for the vocab word 一つ (in the same level as this word), you can know that it uses the same reading!
4 | 人工 | じんこう | Artificial | Man Made\n Human Made | A person of industry makes a lot of things by hand, so everything they make is artificial, and also means it's man made. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nRemember this by thinking about how jeans (じん) are artificial. You've never seen jeans growing on trees, right? Nope, jeans are 100% man made.
5 | 下 | した | Below | Under\n Beneath\n Down | When a vocab is a single kanji with no okurigana (that's hiragana attached to the kanji) it tends to steal the meaning of the kanji it comes from. So, this one is below or under. \n When a vocab is a single kanji and is alone it tends to use the kun'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi reading for this kanji, so now it's time to learn the kun'yomi reading to learn this vocabulary word.\nWhat's below you? What's below your foot? Oh no. The worst thing possible: It's した.
6 | 大きい | おおきい | Big | Large | This is the adjective form of big. It has the same meaning, though it is a word for describing. Words that end with い are often adjectives, remember that for future words as well. So, as long as you know the meaning of this kanji, you can transfer that to the meaning of this word. It's the adjective big, or large. \n What do you do when you see something really, really big? You say おお because you can't believe your eyes. Imagine something really large and say おお out loud to help seal the memory in that brain of yours.
7 | 八 | はち | Eight |  | When a vocab is a single kanji it usually steals its meaning from its kanji as well. Same goes for this vocab word. It means eight. \n When a vocab is a single kanji and all alone like this, it's usually going to use the kun'yomi. But, because this is a number (exception) it uses the on'yomi instead, meaning you already know the reading from when you learned the kanji!
8 | 八つ | やっつ | Eight Things |  | This word follows the "number of things" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means "____ things." Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for eight plus つ. So, this one is eight things. \n Since all of the "number of things" words follow the same pattern (number + つ), you really just have to remember the part before the つ (and then remember that the つ is in all of these). All of the readings are kun'yomi, and since you only know the on'yomi reading for the kanji, we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them.\nSo what eight things do you have? You have eight yachts (やっつ). Go ahead and count them, drifting on the water. They're beautiful. Also, be sure not to be confused by this particular reading mnemonic. It includes the つ, even though the つ is outside the reading you need to learn (just makes things easier for you overall). Since you can see the つ outside, it shouldn't be too difficult for you.
9 | 入り口 | いりぐち | Entrance |  | A mouth that you enter is an entrance. \n This word is really two separate words put together to form one, so let's look at it in two parts:\nThe kanji 入 has り attached to it as okurigana (hiragana that comes after a kanji), so you can bet that 入り will use a kun'yomi reading for the kanji. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThe entrance you're going through is really eerie (いり). It has cobwebs and creepy figures carved into it, and it just gives you a really eerie feeling.\nSince 入り uses the kun'yomi, you can guess that 口 will follow suit. You learned this reading with the vocabulary, but the く in くち changes to ぐ due to something called rendaku. Think of it as an eerie entrance into the Gucci (ぐち) store.
10 | 大した | たいした | Great | Considerable\n Important\n Big Deal | した is the past tense form of する (which means "to do"). So, essentially this word is "did big." What is something that "did big"? It's something that's great or considerable. \n The reading for the 大 part is actually the on'yomi reading you learned when learning this kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nWhen something's great and important, you'd better wear a tie (たい) for it. No showing up without a tie to anything that's a big deal, okay?
11 | 山 | やま | Mountain |  | A vocab made of a single kanji all alone with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) usually has the same exact meaning as the kanji it's made from. So by that you know that this vocab's meaning is mountain. \n When a vocab is a single kanji all alone with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's usually going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn when you learned the kanji. To remember this word's reading we'll use a mnemonic.\nWhat are you doing going up into the mountains? You're hunting for yams (やま). Go ahead, imagine yourself doing just that, climbing up the mountain (it's hard work!) and then digging in the ground with your hands, then pulling up that sweet, delicious yam! Mmm!
12 | 口 | くち | Mouth |  | When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's generally going to have the same meaning as the kanji it came from. From that, you know this word's meaning is mouth. \n When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's generally going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you did not learn from learning the kanji. To remember this word, you should use a mnemonic. With your mouth, make a "kuchi kuchi kou" (くち) sound. Go ahead, make it. Focus on your mouth and try to imagine each shape it makes while zooming in on it. You're talking to a baby, which is why you're making all these ridiculous noises. Also, instead of "coo" at the end, you're saying "kou," because that's the reading of the kanji (こう).\nくちくちこう！くちくちこう！ Sounds like something from Arrested Development, actually.
13 | ふじ山 | ふじさん | Mt Fuji | Mount Fuji\n Mt. Fuji | Just look at this word. What do you think it means? That's right - it's a name (Fuji) plus the kanji for mountain. Put those together, and you have Mount Fuji. In English the "Mount(ain)" part comes first. In Japanese, it comes at the end, sort of like the name ender さん, ちゃん, and so on. You can add 山 to the end of any mountain's name too, not just Mount Fuji. \n Normally ふじ would be in kanji, but I wanted you to see this kanji use in action since it's more useful than just being used on Mount Fuji. This is treated like a jukugo word (combo kanji word). In the case of jukugo, usually the on'yomi reading is used, meaning you just have to remember the on'yomi reading of 山. Luckily, you learned this when you were learning the kanji, so you should already know it!
14 | 九 | きゅう | Nine |  | When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it often has the same meaning as the kanji it's based off of. Same goes for the word 九, as well. It has the same meaning as its kanji counterpart. \n When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are the exception, as you might already know. When they're alone with no okurigana they're the on'yomi reading, which you should already know from learning the kanji that makes up this word.
15 | 九つ | ここのつ | Nine Things |  | This word follows the "number of things" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means "____ things." Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for nine plus つ. So, this one is nine things. \n Since all of the "number of things" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つ), you really just have to remember the part before the つ (and then remember that the つ is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).\nWhat thing do you have nine of? The nine things you have are nine coconots (ここの). As you can guess from the spelling, coconots are not coconuts. Think of them as… fake coconuts. Imagine yourself juggling nine coconots in the air. Try counting them as you do, arriving at nine things. Then arrange them into a square on the ground. Three coconots by three. Now you should remember how to read 九つ.
16 | 一 | いち | One |  | As is the case with most vocab words that consist of a single kanji, this vocab word has the same meaning as the kanji it parallels, which is one. \n When a vocab word is all alone and has no okurigana (hiragana attached to kanji) connected to it, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, however. When a number is all alone, with no kanji or okurigana, it is going to be the on'yomi reading, which you learned with the kanji.  Just remember this exception for alone numbers and you'll be able to read future number-related vocab to come.
17 | 一つ | ひとつ | One Thing |  | This word follows the "number of things" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means "____ things." Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for one plus つ. So, this one is one thing. \n Since all of the "number of things" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つ), you really just have to remember the part before the つ (and then remember that the つ is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).\nSo, you have one thing. What one thing do you have? You have one of He-Man's Toes, aka a single He-Toe (ひと). So what's the thing you have only one of? You have one He-Toe. Imagine He-Man walking around with one missing toe, trying to find you so he can get it back. At least you'll be able to run faster than him now.
18 | 人 | ひと | Person |  | When a vocab is a single kanji all alone, it usually has the same meaning as its kanji parent. That goes for this vocab word as well. Person is person. \n When a vocab is a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Since you don't know the kun'yomi reading for this kanji yet, let's use a mnemonic to learn it.\nWhat does a person hate more than anything? They hate extreme heat (ひと). You can always put on more clothes to stay warm, but when the heat gets too high, you can only take off so much.
19 | 下さい | ください | Please Give Me | Please | You know that the kanji 下 means down, and さい sounds like the word "sigh." You need to ask someone for something, so you look down, sigh, and say please give me that thing. You're ashamed that you have to ask. But you still need it. Please, please give it to me!\nYou only use this kanji version of ください when asking for something, which is why this is "please give me." If you're just saying "please," you don't need the kanji at all! \n The reading for 下 here is one you haven't learned. Just think about how it kind of sounds like you're saying please, could I (くだ) have this thing? Pretty please, could I have it?\nAlternatively, if you already knew the word ください beforehand, this shouldn't be too hard!
20 | 人口 | じんこう | Population |  | The amount of people with mouths (that you have to feed) is the population that you have to feed. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nHere at Tofugu, we measure population in jeans (じん). Each of us has just one pair of jeans, so if you know the jean count you know the population.
21 | 力 | ちから | Power | Strength\n Ability | When a vocab word is made up of a single kanji and that's it, it almost always takes the meaning from its parent kanji. So, this vocab word also means power. \n When a vocab word is a single kanji all alone with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn the kun'yomi reading with the kanji, so for this vocab word, we'll use a mnemonic.\nThe most powerful man in the world. All his power came from his cheek (ちから). Imagine him blowing up his cheek like a giant balloon, then unleashing his power on you. Thwap thwap thwap thwap.
22 | 川 | かわ | River |  | When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it will usually take the same meaning as the kanji it comes from. So, from that you know that this word means river. \n You're in luck - the reading you learned with the kanji is the same as the one you have to learn for this vocab!
23 | 七 | なな | Seven |  | When a vocab is alone with no okurigana (that's hiragana attached to a kanji) it usually has the same meaning as the kanji too. That goes for this word as well. So, if you know the kanji's meaning (seven) you'll know the vocab's meaning (seven). \n Most single-kanji all-alone vocab words like this use the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception to this rule. That being said, four and seven are exceptions to this exception to the rule (because the on'yomi readings sound too much like the word for "death"). You should learn both readings for this word, though we're going to go with なな for the main one here. You can remember that because you had seven nanas after you.
24 | 七つ | ななつ | Seven Things |  | This word follows the "number of things" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means "____ things." Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for seven plus つ. So, this one is seven things. \n Since all of the "number of things" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つ), you really just have to remember the part before the つ (and then remember that the つ is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).\nWhat thing do you have seven of? The seven things that you have are seven Nanas (なな). These are your grandmas, cloned. Just think, "It's lucky to have seven nanas. They can all cook my favorite foods for me!" What's more, you have one nana for every day of the week, so you'll get your favorite food every day.
25 | 大きさ | おおきさ | Size |  | In Japanese, さ on the end of a word is often the equivalent of "-ness" in English. In other words, if you replace the い on the end of an い-adjective with さ, you have a noun. In this case, the adjective is 大きい (big) and the noun 大きさ means "bigness", aka size. \n When a vocab has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it is probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. Since you learned the on'yomi reading with the kanji 大, we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember this word.\nWhen you saw the size of (pick something surprising), you said "おお *#$@!" Really imagine something surprising. Say the おお part out loud, as well. Think about the size of whatever you're looking at, too, and how big it is.
26 | 十 | じゅう | Ten |  | When a vocab is alone like this with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it tends to steal its meaning from the kanji it came from. That means this vocab word also means ten. \n When a vocab is alone and consists of a single kanji like this, usually it uses the kun'yomi reading for the kanji. But, numbers are an exception and they use the on'yomi reading (which you learned when you learned the kanji). That means you know that this word's reading is じゅう already.
27 | 三 | さん | Three |  | When a vocab is a single kanji and alone like this, it usually steals its meaning from the parent kanji. That goes for this word too, making the meaning of this word three. \n When a vocab is alone like this with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually uses its kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, though, and use the on'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi reading when you learned this kanji, so you already know that the reading for this vocab is さん.
28 | 三人 | さんにん | Three People | Three Persons | You have the kanji for three and person. Common sense will tell you what this word is. It's three people. \n This is a jukugo (kanji compound) word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nApparently, there are three people working as Santa-san at Nintendo (さんにん)! It's a big company, so obviously they need three Santas.
29 | 三つ | みっつ | Three Things |  | This word follows the "number of things" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means "____ things." Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for three plus つ. So, this one is three things. \n Since all of the "number of things" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つ), you really just have to remember the part before the つ (and then remember that the つ is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).\nWhat thing do you have three of? The three things that you have are actually three versions of yourself. "Who is the real one?" you ask yourself. "It's me!" "Wait, no, it's me!" Just remember that there are three of you, and they're all saying "me me me me me" to try and prove that they're the real you.
30 | 入る | はいる | To Enter | To Go In | This vocab word has okurigana, which is the hiragana part that comes after the kanji. When a vocab's okurigana makes an "う/oo" sound (in this case, we have a る), it's often going to be a verb. So in this case, the kanji 入 is enter. The vocab 入る is to enter. We're just taking the kanji and using it in a verb! \n When a vocab is a single kanji with okurigana, chances are it's going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you don't usually learn in the kanji (you usually learn the on'yomi reading). So, let's learn the kun'yomi reading for this word using its meaning.\nWhen you enter the room, what do you do? You say "Hi" (はい) to everyone to the point of absurdity. "Hi there. Oh hi Frank. Oh hi there Susan. Oh hi there lamp."
31 | 上げる | あげる | To Lift Something | To Raise Something\n To Increase Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means above and this verb is related to that meaning. It means to lift something or to raise something. It's a transitive verb, meaning that you do something to something else. You raise something. Like your hands! \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou want to lift something, and that something is aardvark (あ) above your head. Why? Because even though aardvarks have long tongues, they can't reach the ants in the trees. But when you raise this aardvark it can get at those yummy ants!
32 | 下げる | さげる | To Lower Something | To Hang Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means below so the verb version of that is when you put something below you. It's to lower something. It can also mean to hang something, such as a lamp from the ceiling.\nThis is a transitive verb, which means that the verb is done by one entity onto another. In other words, you lower something. Like your impossibly high expectations for yourself. Take it easy! \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou want to lower something. In this case, it's a tree, so you need a saw (さ). Lower the tree to the ground gently while you slowly saw it down!
33 | 二 | に | Two |  | When a vocab word is a single kanji without okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually has the same meaning as the kanji it's spawned from. If you know the kanji meaning you'll also know the vocab meaning. It's two! \n When a vocab word is a single kanji with no okurigana, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception to this. Numbers use the on'yomi reading, which you've already learned by learning the kanji's reading! How nice!
34 | 二人 | ふたり | Two People | Pair\n Couple\n Two Persons | When you have two and person and then put them together, what do you get? You get a pair or two people. \n The reading for this word is quite strange. If you know 二つ's reading, you can use that to remember the 二 part (ふた). But, the り that is the 人 is a total exception, something you won't see too often (though you may have seen it in 一人). If you can use the reading of 一人 (aka if you've learned it already) then definitely use that. If not, do your best to remember the reading on your own. It's a strange one that doesn't connect to much else.
35 | 二つ | ふたつ | Two Things |  | This word follows the "number of things" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means "____ things." Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for two plus つ. So, this one is two things. \n Since all of the "number of things" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つつつtwo things you have are 2-foot tacos (ふた). How lucky are you, that your two things are 2-foot tacos? Other people only have two foot-tacos... And trust me, you don't want to eat those.
36 | 力いっぱい | ちからいっぱい | With All One's Strength | Full Power\n As Hard As One Can | You've hopefully already learned that 力 means "power." You might have also heard the word いっぱい, because it's used a lot in conversation. It has a few meanings (you'll learn more of them later) but the important one here is "full" or "a lot." Put these two words together and you have full power, with all one's strength, and as hard as one can. Remember this one with all your strength!\nJust a side note: いっぱい can also be written in kanji, which you'll learn later on! However, in simple words like this one it's usually written in kana. \n 力 uses the same reading as you learned with the vocabulary. That's because this is basically two separate words stuck together.
37 | 女 | おんな | Woman | Female | When a kanji is alone and doesn't have any okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's usually going to take the same meaning as the kanji it comes from. So in this case, you know that this word means woman.\nBut watch out! Using 女 on its own can often come off as blunt and disrespectful, especially in casual chats. We’ll introduce you to neutral equivalents soon! \n When a word is a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it tends to use a kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn the kun'yomi reading when you learned the kanji itself, so let's use a mnemonic to remember the vocab word.\nThere's a woman in front of you. Who is she? She's Mona (おんな) Lisa!
38 | 四月 | しがつ | April |  | 月 in Japanese means "moon" but it also means "month." Why? Probably because the moon takes about a month to get through its cycles. So, what's the fourth moon of the year? Here's a hint, it's the same as the fourth month of the year: April. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 月 has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the がつ reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\nIn April, you habitually eat sheep guts (しがつ). It's a tradition you started many years ago, and now you just can't stop eating sheep guts every April. Delicious!
39 | 玉 | たま | Ball |  | As a single kanji vocab on its own, you know this vocab word has the same meaning as its parent kanji: ball.\n玉 can be used for round objects traditionally recognized in Japanese culture, like beads, marbles, pearls, snowballs, and pachinko balls. For balls used in sports, people typically use the katakana word ボール. \n This word uses the same reading as the one you learned with the kanji: たま.
40 | 本 | ほん | Book |  | This vocab word is exactly the same as its parent kanji, including its meaning as well: book. It doesn't have those other meanings though, when it's just 本 alone, it's just a book. \n The reading for this word is the same as the single kanji it comes from.
41 | 子 | こ | Child | Kid | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou see a child and walk up to him. Then, you punch him in the face (oh no, how could you!!?). He flies through the air, and he's knocked out. A ref nearby yells that it was a "KO!" (こ). That's a knock out.\nMake sure you learn this reading pretty well too. Both readings for 子 are going to show up a lot, and this is how you're going to learn the kun'yomi one.
42 | 丸 | まる | Circle | Round\n Circular | This vocab word and the kanji that makes it have the same meaning: Circle. \n The reading you learned for this kanji is the kun'yomi one. Since this vocab word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Guess what? That means you already know it!
43 | 丸い | まるい | Circular | Round\n Spherical | With an い on the end, you can guess that this word is an い-adjective. What is the adjective version of the kanji 丸? "Circle" becomes circular, spherical or round. This, compared to another similar word (円), is more general purpose and can be used with 3D spherical objects as well. \n This word uses the reading you learned for the kanji 丸, though you'll need to tack the い onto the end too.
44 | 正しい | ただしい | Correct | True\n Right | Ending with an い tells you that this word is an い-adjective. So since you know that the kanji 正 means "correct," what is the adjective version of that word? Well, it's also correct. \n This word uses a reading you didn't learn from the kanji. You have to remember the ただ portion in order to read this word, so think about it this way:\nAfter you get the answer correct a clown jumps out of nowhere yelling "Ta-da (ただ)!!!" Imagine it scaring the crap out of you, too.
45 | 土 | つち | Dirt | Soil\n Earth | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n土 generally refers to dirt or soil or earth. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it:\nYou look through the soil. You're trying to find something. As you dig and sift, you come across not one but two cheeses (つち). Pull them out of the ground and put them in your mouth. How do the two cheeses taste and compare?
46 | 犬 | いぬ | Dog |  | This vocab made up of a single kanji shares its meaning with said single kanji. That meaning is dog. \n Since this is a word made up of a single kanji and nothing else, you can assume that this word will use the kun'yomi reading. The reading you learned for this kanji happens to be the kun'yomi reading as well. So if you know the kanji you know the reading.
47 | 八日 | ようか | Eighth Day | Eight Days\n Day Eight | Eighth day or day eight. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense. \n Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:\nEvery eighth day you have to buy yogurt to fuel your car (ようか). Your car runs on yogurt, but it needs to be refilled every eight days to keep running. It's really inconvenient because it's just ONE day more than a week. And a week just feels better. Oh well.
48 | 出口 | でぐち | Exit |  | The mouth you exit out of is just a doorway (I hope), but an easier way to describe this word or concept is to call it an exit. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 出口 is an exception to this rule, however, and uses its kun'yomi readings. There's no particular reason why this is, but oftentimes a "body part" word (like mouth) changes a word to use kun'yomi readings instead of on'yomi ones. You already know the kun'yomi reading for 口 (くち) from learning the vocab, but to remember the reading for 出 you can think the following:\nIf I exit out this mouth, I'll end up in the ocean (you were swallowed by a whale) and I will surely end up dead (で).\nAlso keep in mind that because of rendaku, くち becomes ぐち.
49 | 目 | め | Eye |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned for the kanji, meaning you should already know it!
50 | 目玉 | めだま | Eyeball |  | What is an eye ball? Oh wait, that's easy. It's an eyeball! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 目玉, however, is an exception. Perhaps this is because it includes a body part (the eye) in it, which often makes a word switch to kun'yomi readings. Either way, it doesn't matter too much. Both the readings you learned for the kanji in this word are the kun'yomi, meaning you should know how to read this one. Just make sure you watch out for the rendaku.
51 | 二月 | にがつ | February |  | The kanji 月 means both month and moon (because moon cycles take about a month, presumably). So, what is the number two month? It's not January... it's not March... it's February! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 月 has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the がつ reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\nFebruary is the month when somebody gives you a knee in the guts (にがつ). A complete stranger comes around each February just to knee you right in the guts. Ouch! That's why February is your least favourite month.
52 | 五日 | いつか | Fifth Day | Day Five\n Five Days | Day five or the fifth day. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense. \n Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:\nOn the fifth day I have to eat (いつ) five cars (か). Now imagine yourself eating five cars. How did you manage to get past the first one? I'm impressed.
53 | 五十 | ごじゅう | Fifty |  | What happens when you have ten five times? You get fifty! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. That's the case for this word too, which means you should already know how to read this word.
54 | 火 | ひ | Fire |  | This vocab is made from a single kanji, which means it shares the same meaning as the parent kanji: fire. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nWhat comes off of fire? Lots and lots of heat (ひ). Feel it coming off the fire, touching and warming your face.
55 | 五 | ご | Five |  | This vocab is made from a single kanji, which means it shares the same meaning as the parent kanji: Five. \n Since numbers are an exception, this word is read using the on'yomi reading even though it's made from a single kanji all alone. Luckily for you, you learned the reading for this word when you learned the parent kanji.
56 | 五つ | いつつ | Five Things |  | From previous number + つ words, you can probably guess that this word means five things. \n The reading of this word is the kun'yomi reading of the kanji 五, meaning you didn't learn it when you learned the parent kanji reading. To remember this word, think of it this way:\nYou have five things. What do you have to do with them? You need to eat (いつ) them. Just imagine having five delicious things to eat, sticking each on one finger of your hand, and then eating them one after another. And make sure to count down from five while doing it!
57 | 四 | よん | Four |  | This vocab word has the same meaning as its parent kanji (single alone kanji usually do that!), meaning it means four. \n When a vocab is alone like this with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually uses its kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, though, and use the on'yomi reading. However, four and seven actually use both. We're going to go with the kun'yomi reading here, and since you haven't learned this reading yet, here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to count to four. But you're tired. One... two... three... *YAWN* ... four. There, you did it. But *yawn* now you can't stop yawning. You're so, so sleepy. Four is too high a number to count without falling asleep.\nBy the way! Both the reading よん and し are pretty common, but because the on'yomi reading し sounds just like the word for "death," it isn't used as much. Generally when you're just counting (for example, "1, 2, 3, 4..."), you will use the reading し. But when you are counting things or people, you'll use よん. There are exceptions to this, but you'll learn them as they come up.
58 | 天才 | てんさい | Genius |  | If heaven has given you talent, you must be a genius. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. As long as you know the readings for these kanji, you should be able to read this word just fine.
59 | 女子 | じょし | Girl | Woman\n Female | A woman child is just a girl!\n女子 is a relatively formal word commonly used in contexts where classification or categorization by gender is used, such as in sports or school settings. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
60 | 女の子 | おんなのこ | Girl | Young Girl | A woman child is a girl.\nThis word has two kanji with hiragana stuck in the middle. That hiragana is the particle の. This time, it just means the noun before の is modifying the noun after it.\n女の子 is a casual word for young girls, like kids or teenagers. Sometimes it can also refer to adult women, but only to playfully or affectionately highlight their youthful or girlish qualities. \n Since there's hiragana in here, you can bet that these kanji will use the kun'yomi readings. You already know the kun'yomi reading for 女. The only thing I have to make sure that you know is 子. When you need to remember the kun'yomi reading of 子, just think about you fighting a child (you're a jerk, apparently!). When you hit her in the face, she flies to the floor, and the ref calls out "KO!" because you just knocked the poor kid out.
61 | 上手 | じょうず | Good At | Skillful\n Skilled At\n Skilled | Think of someone holding out their hand. This is average. Things rated below the hand are things you're bad at. Things rated above the hand are things you're good at. \n Both of these kanji use on'yomi readings, though 手 uses an on'yomi reading you didn't learn with the kanji. It's a rare reading, so it wasn't included (and we just have to deal with exceptions like this as we go along). To remember the reading for this word, here's a mnemonic:\nWhat are you good at? You're really good at taking Joe (じょう) to the zoo (ず). No one else can take Joe to the zoo—he gets mad and throws them into the animal enclosures. But you? Joe trusts you.
62 | おはよう | おはよう | Good Morning |  | From Ohio (おはよう), you shout good morning. Why Ohio? Because that's where you woke up this morning. Imagine yourself waking up in Ohio, and wishing everyone "good morning" at the top of your lungs.\nおはよう is a casual way to say "good morning." It can also be written in kanji, but hiragana is much more common.
63 | 手 | て | Hand | Arm | The kanji means hand, and the word means hand too! It can also be used to refer to your whole arm. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Since this is a body part, the kun'yomi reading usually takes priority. That means you learned the kun'yomi reading already when you learned the kanji.
64 | 天 | てん | Heaven |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it would normally use the kun'yomi reading. The kanji that makes this word only has one important reading, though, and that happens to be the on'yomi. Since you learned the on'yomi reading for this kanji, you've already learned the reading for this word.
65 | ホテル | ホテル | Hotel |  | ホテル comes from the English word hotel and the meaning is exactly the same!\nThe only thing to watch out for is that the "l" on the end becomes ル, because that's the closest sound in Japanese.
66 | 入力 | にゅうりょく | Input | Enter\n Entry | Enter something with all your strength and you will look down to see that what you're doing is inputting data. You're inputting it right now! Into this site! The answers you enter into WaniKani with all your strength can be said with this word. Wow. Full circle already, and you're only on level 2. Look at you go! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 力 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nWhere you work, inputting things earns you new locks (にゅうりょく). Not only is your job only about entering things into a computer, you're also paid exclusively in new locks. Maybe consider a career change!
67 | 中 | なか | Inside | In | When the middle kanji is used as a word, it means inside. When you're in the middle of something, it means you're in that thing! \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThere's a sound coming from inside the wall. It sounds like a knock, knock, knock noise. You break down the wall, and there's some creepy dude standing inside. He is the knocker (なか).
68 | 一月 | いちがつ | January |  | Since the kanji 月 mean both moon and month (because a moon cycle is about a month, presumably), what is the number one month? In English we have an actual name for it, and that name is January. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 月 has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the がつ reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\nJanuary always gives you itchy guts (いちがつ). It's a weird affliction that comes around every January and makes your guts incredibly itchy. Probably due to all that overindulgence over the new year.
69 | 日本 | にほん | Japan |  | Remember the secondary meaning of 本 being "origin"? That technically makes this sun origin. Does that sound familiar? Japan is known as the "land of the rising sun", which is why this means Japan! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. The 本 is read just how you learned it, but the 日 reading is sort of an exception here, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou've finally arrived in Japan and immediately fall down on your knees (に). After two excruciatingly long flights, you've finally made it. You're here. This is Japan. Now get up off your knees, people are starting to stare.
70 | 六月 | ろくがつ | June |  | Since the kanji 月 means both "moon" and "month," what is the sixth month of the year? January, February, March, April, May, June! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 月 has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the がつ reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\nJune always gives you rock guts (ろくがつ). In June, your guts mysteriously become as hard as rock, which makes for terrible indigestion.
71 | 王 | おう | King |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned when learning the kanji.
72 | 夕べ | ゆうべ | Last Night | Evening | I spent all evening in be(べ)d  last night. It was a really chilled evening. \n When hiragana is attached to a kanji, you can usually assume that that kanji is going to be read using the kun'yomi reading, which is exactly what's going on with this word as well. By learning this word's kanji you've also learned the reading for this word.
73 | 左右 | さゆう | Left And Right | Both Ways\n Influence\n Control | Put left and right together and you end up with left and right! Just make sure you say them in the right order! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
74 | 左 | ひだり | Left Direction | Left | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nImagine hearing someone to your left saying, "Hi Da'ri!" (ひだり) which is supposed to be "Hi There," or "Hi Dearie." You turn left and there's no one there. You hear it again, "Hi Da'ri!" Keep turning to the left until you find the person saying hi to you.
75 | 五月 | ごがつ | May |  | The moon kanji also represents a month, so when you have five of these months, what month of the year is it? That would be May, the greatest month of the year (because it has towel day in it!). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 月 has two on'yomi readings, but it always uses the がつ reading in the names of the months, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\nMay is when you and your buddies get together to eat Godzilla guts (ごがつ). You go hunting for Godzilla just for his delicious guts, and then eat them with your friends. Yummy.
76 | 月 | つき | Moon | Month | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nLook up at that big, bright moon. You have to open it up and take what's inside. To do that, you are required to have two keys (つき), and they have to be turned at the same time. Imagine you and a friend both turning your keys on opposite sides of the moon to open up the center.
77 | 九日 | ここのか | Ninth Day | Nine Days\n Day Nine | Ninth day or day nine. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense. \n Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both of the kanji. You learned this reading for 九 when you learned 九つ, so you should be able to read this one too!
78 | 十月 | じゅうがつ | October |  | The kanji for "moon" and "month" are the same, probably because a moon cycle takes approximately a month to occur. So, what is the tenth moon cycle of the year? That would be the awesome month October! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 月 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nOctober gives you jewel guts (じゅうがつ). In October, your guts magically produce jewels, which you collect to make some pretty awesome Halloween costumes.
79 | 一日 | いちにち | One Day | Day One\n First Day | This word has two different meanings. One day and first day. No matter how you look at this word, those meanings make a lot of sense. \n The first meaning is one day, and it has the same reading as the kanji you learned, so you should already know this reading.\nThe reading for ”first day," however, is a big old exception. It doesn’t take the on’yomi or kun’yomi readings, and has its own special (weird) readings. Here’s a mnemonic to help  you remember this one:\nOn the first day of a new relationship you just tweet a cheesy (ついたち) line at each other. You're so in love you can't speak normally, so you just use bird calls and cheesy lines to communicate.
80 | 一千 | いっせん | One Thousand |  | If you have one thousand, you have... one thousand.\nSimply saying 千 is the most common way to say 1,000, but sometimes you might use 一千 to emphasize or clarify the exact number. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The only thing that's a bit weird is the reading of the 一. The ち turns into a small っ, making the reading for this word いっせん.
81 | 千円 | せんえん | One Thousand Yen | A Thousand Yen\n Thousand Yen | A thousand of these yen things makes this word one thousand yen. \n Since you know the on'yomi readings of these two kanji, you should know the reading for this vocab word as well!
82 | 玉ねぎ | たまねぎ | Onion |  | ねぎ means "onion" in Japanese. But, there are different kinds of onions, right? This happens to be a "ball onion," which is just one of those round ones, like a Walla Walla Sweet Onion. Do you know? \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can guess it will probably use the kun'yomi reading. Luckily, that's the reading you learned with the only kanji in this word, so you should be able to read it!
83 | 人々 | ひとびと | People |  | Person person, why, that's more than one person. It's people! \n The reading is the vocab word 人 twice, with the second one getting rendaku'd, turning it into びと.
84 | 王子 | おうじ | Prince |  | The king's child is the prince. Someday he'll be the 王, if he's lucky, but right now he's just the king's child, a.k.a. the prince!\nIf you prefer some grammatical details, you can try to remember that when a word consists of two kanji, sometimes the first kanji has a possessive relation to the second. In this case, 王 possesses 子, making it the king's child. Historically, male children had priority in royal succession, so I guess that's why this word means "prince." \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Also take note that the reading for 子 (し) is changed to じ.\nThat said, this reading can be easy to confuse with other similar words, so here's a mnemonic to help you out:\nThe prince is always saying "Ohh, Jesus (おうじ), please let me be king!" In fact, the prince probably says "Ohh, Jesus" to ask for help at least once a day.
85 | 王女 | おうじょ | Princess |  | The king's woman (or girl) is the princess.\nYou know she's the princess because she comes after the king — she's just his daughter and doesn't have as much power. Imagine the king with a young woman following after him. Must be the princess!\nIf you prefer some grammatical details, you can try to remember that when a word consists of two kanji, sometimes the first kanji has a possessive relation to the second. In this case, 王 possesses 女, making it the king's girl (almost like "daddy's girl"). In other words, the princess! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. That said, this reading can be easy to confuse with other similar words, so here's a mnemonic to help you out:\nThe princess is named Jo-Ann Jr. (じょ), or Jo for short , and she loves making people say "Ohh, Jo!" (王女) by sneaking up and scaring them. Whenever you think of the princess now, imagine how many times people have screamed "Ohh, Jo!" at her.
86 | 子犬 | こいぬ | Puppy |  | A child dog is a puppy! \n Even though this is a jukugo word, it doesn't use the on'yomi readings. Both the kanji 子 and 犬 often favor kun'yomi readings, and this word is no exception. The reading for 犬 is the one you already know, and the reading for 子 as こ is a really common one (perhaps you've already learned that reading?). If not, just think about punching a puppy in the face, and giving it a KO (That's a knock out).
87 | 女王 | じょおう | Queen |  | The woman king is the queen.\nYou know this because the woman who comes before the king must be the queen. Imagine this woman in front, leading the king around. Only a queen could do that!\nFor a more technical explanation, just remember that when a word consists of two kanji characters, the first kanji often modifies the second. In this case, 女 modifies 王, making it the woman king, a.k.a. the queen! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. That said, this reading can be easy to confuse with other similar words, so here's a mnemonic to help you out:\nThe queen is named Jo-Ann (じょ), or Jo for short, and she's always joking. Hey, wait a minute. Jo… king. 女… king. Jo… おう!! 女王! Get it? When you think of the queen, just remember how much she loves joking (女王).
88 | 中々 | なかなか | Rather | Fairly\n Quite | The 々 symbol just repeats the kanji that comes before it. In other words, 中々 is the same as 中中. Easy! So with 中々, you have middle x2. When something is more middle than middle itself, it's rather, fairly, or quite something. Why? I guess because those are all good middle-level intensifiers.\n中々 can be used in positive or negative ways. In a positive way, it usually means something is better than expected, like 中々おいしい (quite delicious). But it's really versatile and could also mean "a little," "very," or "completely" depending on the situation. It might even sound condescending, so be careful how you use it! In a negative sense, you can use it when something is more difficult than expected, like in 中々できない (can't be done easily). \n The reading for this word is the kun'yomi reading, since it's like putting two single kanji together rather than a true jukugo word. To learn the kun'yomi reading, take a look at this mnemonic:\nFrom the middle of the middle comes a sound. It is a knocking sound. Knock. Knock. Knock. You open up the walls around this thing. Then you open up the second set of walls (middle of the middle). Inside is an old man, who identifies himself as "the knocker." You go inside of him and find another knocker as well. That's why it's a knocker knocker (なかなか).
89 | 田 | た | Rice Paddy | Rice Field | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nJust keep in mind that compared to 田んぼ, which you learned earlier, this word is more formal and less colloquial. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When you learned the kanji that makes up this word, all you learned was the kun'yomi reading, so you should be good to go.
90 | 田んぼ | たんぼ | Rice Paddy |  | You know that the kanji 田 means rice paddy, so it should be easy to work out that this word also means rice paddy.\nBut… what's the んぼ on the end? It sounds like jumbo (んぼ), so let's say it's a cute ending added by Japanese rice farmers, to make their rice paddies sound bigger than they are.\nThis word also happens to be a common way of saying "rice paddy" in conversation compared to its formal version, which you will be learning soon. \n This word has hiragana attached to the kanji, which is a good sign that the reading is kun'yomi. You learned that reading when you learned the kanji, so you should be good to go.
91 | 右 | みぎ | Right Direction | Right | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nLook to the right. There are meat geese (みぎ) over there. What are meat geese, you ask? They're geese made of meat, that sit to the right of you, trying to get you to do bad things. Like the devil/angel motif you see in cartoons. Well there's nothing on your left. And on your right? Just meat geese. Watching you. Waiting. Geese made of meat. Telling you not to do the right thing.
92 | 二日 | ふつか | Second Day | Day Two\n Two Days | Second day or day two. No matter how you look at this combination of kanji, the meaning of the word makes a lot of sense! \n Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:\nThe circus is in town this weekend and you can't wait to get there. You want to show off your new foots car (ふつか) to all the circus clowns. But you have to use your feet to get it there and it ends up taking you two days! Darn this old fashioned foots car!
93 | 七日 | なのか | Seventh Day | Day Seven\n Seven Days | Seventh day or day seven. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense. \n Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:\nYou've been stuck inside working for seven days and today you finally have a day off. Your friend asks you if you want to go for a drive but you say, "Nah, no car today" (なのか), because you've been cooped up long enough. Seven days is too long to be inside.
94 | 六 | ろく | Six |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. Numbers, as you know, are the exception to this rule. They usually use the on'yomi reading, and the on'yomi reading is the one you learned along with this kanji, meaning you should be good to go!
95 | 十六 | じゅうろく | Sixteen |  | You have ten and six (not to be confused with six tens!). When you have ten and six, you have a total of sixteen. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well!
96 | 六日 | むいか | Sixth Day | Day Six\n Six Days | It's the kanji for six and day. Put them together and you have the sixth day (or day six). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. This is an exception, though. When you're counting days (at least one through ten), the kun'yomi readings are used. So let's think about that sixth day - what does it entail?\nOn the sixth day of your roadtrip, you've finally arrived at your destination. You get out of your car and tell it, "Muy (むい) bien car (か), muy bien!".
97 | 六つ | むっつ | Six Things |  | Any number with a つ attached to it means you are counting that number of things. In this case, it's six things. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can guess that it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you do that:\nWhat are the six things that you need to count? This time you are counting six cows. The reason it's six is because you wanted exactly six moos (むっ). No more, no less. You're very particular about your moos.
98 | 小さい | ちいさい | Small | Little | This kanji has hiragana attached and ends with an い sound. That means it's probably an adjective (and it is!). So, if you take the kanji 小 and its meaning (small), you can figure out the adjective version of it. What is the adjective version of "small?" Actually, it's the same thing: small. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the ちい portion:\nWhen you think of the word small, try to think of this cheese (ちい) store. You go inside, and all of their cheeses are so small. They hand you a magnifying glass to see all the cheeses. You look at them and exclaim: "Why are these cheeses so small???"
99 | 日 | ひ | Sun | Day | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Take note that this word means both "sun" and "day," though. Why? because the sun takes a day to go around and come back! \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it:\nWhat do you feel from the sun? You feel the heat (ひ).
100 | 刀 | かたな | Sword | Katana | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well! \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. I'm hoping you already know this word - that will make everything much easier. It's かたな (you know what a katana is, right?).
101 | 十日 | とおか | Tenth Day | Ten Days\n Day Ten | Tenth day or day ten. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense. \n Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it actually uses kun’yomi readings. Think about this word this way:\nThis marks the tenth day since this talker (とおか) began talking non-stop. Talkers love talking, but this one is getting quite unbearable… Ten days of talking, can you believe it?\nNote that とお, generally pronounced "toh" with a long "o" sound, is not a common spelling, and you’ll only see it with a handful of kanji and vocabulary, like in this case. I mean, how often do you encounter a talker who can go on non-stop for ten days? That's pretty rare, right?
102 | 三日 | みっか | Third Day | Day Three\n Three Days | Third day or day three. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Counting days, however, are an exception (at least up to ten). You need to use the kun'yomi readings to read this word. You already know the kun'yomi reading for 三 from when you learned the word 三つ. Here is a way to remember the reading for 日:\nOn the third day you have to give me (み) a ride in your car (か). I don't have a car of my own, so don't forget me, okay?
103 | 千 | せん | Thousand |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Normally a single kanji making up a word like this means it will use the kun'yomi readings. Numbers are generally the exception, though, which means this word uses the on'yomi reading. If you learned the kanji, then you should already know this!
104 | 上る | のぼる | To Climb | To Go Up | This word means to climb. You can tell this word is a verb because it ends with an う sound (る, in this case). Its meaning is similar to the meaning of the 上 kanji, which is "above." So this word is all about moving "above" something (in other words, climbing!) \n 上る consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, so it will use the kun'yomi reading of the kanji. For 上, there are multiple kun'yomi readings, and you didn't learn this one yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou want to climb the mountain, but a gruff old man grabs your shoulder and says "No boy, you ain't climbing that thing, not today." If you're not a boy, think about how weird it is that he called you a boy. If you are a grown man, think how you wish he called you "dude" or something, not "boy." If you're a boy, well... think about how appropriate it is that he said "no boy."
105 | 正す | ただす | To Correct |  | This word is made up of a kanji with some hiragana attached, ending in an う sound. That means this word is a verb. The kanji itself means "correct," so what is the verb form of that? It would be to correct. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nAfter you correct something for someone, you yell out ta-da (ただ) very excitedly. Go ahead and imagine yourself doing this a few times to help you to remember.
106 | 出る | でる | To Exit | To Leave\n To Attend\n To Come Out\n To Go Out | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means "exit" so what is the verb form of this? It is to exit. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou want to exit the room you're in. Why? Because it has a dead (で) body in it. Seriously. You should exit now. It's a dead (で) room (る)!
107 | 立つ | たつ | To Stand | To Stand Up\n To Rise | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means "stand" so what is the verb version of that? It's to stand. \n You have to remember the た portion of this word to learn the reading of it. Think of it this way:\nYou have to stand up in order to wave goodbye to someone. When you stand up, you also say ta-ta (た)!
108 | 木 | き | Tree | Wood | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou walk up to the tree. You have to get inside, because it takes you someplace secret. So, you take out your key (き) and put it in the slot, opening the door in the tree so you can slip inside.
109 | 水中 | すいちゅう | Underwater |  | If you're in the middle of a bunch of water, then you're most likely underwater. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
110 | 下手 | へた | Unskillful | Unskilled\n Bad At | Think of someone holding out their hand at shoulder level. Anything above that equals "skillful." Everything below that equals "unskillful." So, in the case of this word, "below hand" means unskillful. \n Sometimes kanji have exceptional readings that are neither on’yomi, nor kun’yomi, and this is one of them. So here’s a mnemonic to help you remember this reading:\nIf you're bad at something and you complain about it, then you're just a hater (へた). Don't be a hater; get better.
111 | 火山 | かざん | Volcano |  | A fire mountain is probably what you think it is: A volcano. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The 山 reading is ざん instead of さん because of rendaku (sequential voicing).
112 | 水 | みず | Water |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nBe sure you always carry water when visiting the me zoo (みず). That's a zoo with rows and rows of cages of... me. And I'm thirsty!
113 | 白 | しろ | White |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nWhite surrounds you. The sheer (しろ) amount of white is overwhelming.
114 | 白人 | はくじん | White Person | Caucasian | This word uses white and person ... put those together and you have a white person, aka a caucasian person. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nImagine a white person you know well wearing their favorite pair of hacked up jeans (はくじん). This person likes to wear jeans with as many rips and holes in them as possible. Now imagine them wearing only their hacked up jeans. What a sight!
115 | 文 | ぶん | Writing | Sentence | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nBy itself, 文 can also just mean sentence, especially in grammatical contexts. \n This word uses one of the readings you learned for the kanji: ぶん. You can remember this by thinking how whenever you're working on your writing, eating a bun (ぶん) helps you write better sentences.
116 | 〜才 | さい | Years Old | Age | Although this word consists of one kanji that is all alone, it doesn't share its meaning with the parent kanji. But the meanings are similar in a way. This word means years old or age. With more years comes more talent, right? That's why this word means "years old" and not "talent," like the parent kanji.\nYou can stick this word onto numbers to say how old someone is!\nSpecial note for all of you advanced learners out there. When discussing age, 〜歳 is the original and correct kanji to use. Because 〜才 is easier to write and has the same reading, it became mainstream. You'll see it used in writing today, especially in elementary schools. In formal writing though, you'll always want to use 〜歳, which you'll learn later on. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned for the kanji, meaning you should already know it! Don't try to type the 〜 part though.
117 | 〜円 | えん | Yen | Japanese Yen | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Be sure to omit the 〜 in your answer as it is only a placeholder for a number.
118 | 少し | すこし | A Little | A Few\n Few | This word is a single kanji with hiragana attached, though there is no specific clue as to what type of word it is. That means you can usually guess it's a noun, adverb or na-adjective (in this case it's a noun / adverb). The meaning of this word is pretty much the same as the kanji, though, making it fairly easy. The kanji meaning for 少 is few, and the meaning of the vocab form is a little or a few. \n Did you know that this word created an English word you probably already know? Have you ever heard someone say "just a skosh"? That's 少し! Hopefully you know this English word and therefore know this Japanese word as well.
119 | アメリカ人 | あめりかじん | American Person |  | The アメリカ part is pretty easy so long as you know katakana. It's the word for "America." You know that 人 means "person," so you can figure out that America + Person = American person. \n Often times, when two kanji come together to form a kanji compound (or jukugo), you use the on'yomi readings. This is similar to that, though instead of another kanji it's a foreign word. This pattern works with almost any country as well. Just add 人 to a country name and you've described the people who live there. You'll see more of these before you're finished here.\nAnd since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nAmericans absolutely love their jeans (じん), it's a well-known fact!
120 | リンゴ | リンゴ | Apple |  | Ringo (リンゴ) just ate your apple! You were about to take a bite, and he grabbed it. What is Ringo doing snatching apples? Surely he can afford his own.\nDid you know that Ringo Starr once appeared in a Japanese TV commercial for apple juice? That might help you remember this word, too!\nリンゴ is also commonly written in hiragana, and even in kanji, but you’ll probably see it in katakana the most.
121 | 矢 | や | Arrow |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned when learning the kanji.
122 | 〜台 | だい | Big Machine Counter | Machine Counter\n Number Of Machines | This counter is used with some kind of machine or device, usually a fairly large one (so nothing itty bitty). Cars are a good example of this. But it can also be used for things like computers, which were once the size of rooms, but are now nice and small. Thanks technology! \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Be sure to omit the 〜 in your answer as it is only a placeholder for a number.
123 | 太字 | ふとじ | Bold Letter | Bold\n Bold Character\n Bold Text\n Boldface | What do you think a fat letter is? If I were to guess, I'd say a bold letter. \n The reading for this one is a bit odd. The 太 uses the ふと from ふとい (kun'yomi) and the 字 is just the normal on'yomi reading for "letter." You have to remember this weird mismatched reading pair on your own, I'm afraid. Perhaps if you think about how fat letters don't really fit with the rest of the text, kind of like how the readings of both kanji also don't fit in it will help?
124 | イギリス人 | いぎりすじん | British Person | Brit | イギリス means "Great Britain" or "United Kingdom." So what is a "Great Britain person?" You guessed it — a British person, or Brit. \n Often times, when two kanji come together to form a kanji compound (or jukugo), you use the on'yomi readings. This is similar to that, though instead of another kanji it's a foreign word. This pattern works with almost any country as well. Just add 人 to a country name and you've described the people who live there. You'll see more of these before you're finished here.\nAnd since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nAs with all words for nationalities, the 人 here is pronounced じん. All nationalities, including Brits, love jeans (じん)!
125 | 字 | じ | Character | Kanji Character\n Letter\n Symbol | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n You only learned one reading for the kanji that makes up this word, and it's the same as the reading for this word (of course). That means you should already know the reading.
126 | 市 | し | City |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned when learning the kanji.
127 | コーヒー | コーヒー | Coffee |  | コーヒー is the katakana version of the English word coffee.\nJust watch out for the second syllable, which changes to ヒー in Japanese.
128 | 牛 | うし | Cow | Bull\n Ox | The kanji and the word are the same. This word is a bit broader than cow though, and can also be used to be bull and ox. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it:\nYou're leading the cows around the field. To get them to move, you yell out "USH, USH, USH!" (うし) because you have a speech impediment and want to say "MUSH MUSH MUSH." Go ahead and say this out loud, yelling it if you can.
129 | 戸口 | とぐち | Doorway |  | A door's mouth is the doorway!\n戸口 is mostly used for doorways that lead outside. It has an old-fashioned feel to it and is becoming less common these days, especially in spoken Japanese.\nYou might notice that this word resembles 出口 (exit) and 入り口 (entrance). Like in those words, the character 口 just represents an opening here. \n The reading for this one is mixed. You get the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, even though it's a combo (jukugo) kanji. Since 戸's only reading is the kun'yomi reading you should know it. Also, you should know the kun'yomi reading for 口 as well from level 1. That means as long as you remember that this is a kun'yomi fest over here, you should be able to read this word. Also watch out for the rendaku (also known as sequential voicing). That just means the く becomes the voiced ぐ.
130 | 生ビール | なまびーる | Draft Beer | Unpasteurized Beer | You just learned the vocab 生, meaning fresh. Combined with the katakana word for beer makes this draft beer or unpasteurized beer.\nNote that while in a lot of countries, "draft beer" refers only to beer that's drawn from a keg, 生ビール can also refer to unpasteurized canned or bottled beer, giving it a shorter shelf-life, but also keeping it fresh. \n Be careful to use kun'yomi for 生 here. Other than that, as long as you know your katakana, you should be good to go!
131 | 山びこ | やまびこ | Echo | Mountain Echo | You know that 山 means mountain. Add the hiragana びこ to the end and this gives you echo. That's because bee children (bee 子) love echos, especially mountain echos! Imagine baby bees buzzing as loudly as they can and hearing their voices echoing back at them through the mountains.\nAs the kanji suggests, 山びこ is generally used to describe the echo you get if you shout in the mountains. To describe other types of echo, you can use the katakana word エコー.\nBy the way, there is actually a kanji for the second part of this word, but it's so rare that it's usually written in kana! \n You learned this kanji reading when you learned the vocabulary 山.
132 | 太い | ふとい | Fat | Thick | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of the fat? It's the same: fat. \n This is the kun'yomi reading of the kanji (because it's a single kanji, all alone with hiragana attached). The part you have to remember is the ふと portion. Let's use a mnemonic.\nThe fat guy never leaves his futon (ふと).
133 | お父さん | おとうさん | Father | Dad\n Papa | This word begins with an honorific (お), making whatever comes after it more elevated. Then there's 父, which you know means father. Lastly, we have the honorific name ender さん. So this is a nice way to say father. You use it when you're talking to your own dad or talking about him with friends. You can also use this when you're talking about your friends' dads.\nIn more formal settings, you'll want to use 父 (pronounced ちち) to talk about your own dad and お父様 to talk about someone else's dad. Don't worry, you'll learn that last kanji in a few lessons. Until then, it's pronounced, おとうさま. \n The part you have to learn to read is the 父 portion. This uses the kun'yomi, which you didn't learn when doing the kanji.\nImagine you are taking your venerable father to とうきょう. He's always wanted to go and this is the trip of a lifetime! Imagine walking through the streets of Tokyo with your Dad, taking in all the sights.
134 | 父 | ちち | Father | Dad | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is the polite and humble form of father. You use this when you're talking about your own father to other people, especially if you aren't very close to them. \n The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned when learning the kanji.
135 | 少ない | すくない | Few | Scarce\n Not Much\n Not Many | This word has a single kanji with hiragana attached, ending in a い. This means you know it's an adjective. What is the adjective form of few? It's also few. \n The reading for this one is fairly difficult, as it's the kun'yomi reading (you can tell it's kun'yomi because of all the hiragana attached). You have to remember the すく part to remember the reading of this word. Think of it this way:\nYou have a few of something. This something is suckers (すく). Imagine putting all (three-ish) of them in your mouth at once. How does it taste? Can you taste the flavors from each of the few?
136 | 五台 | ごだい | Five Machines |  | As long as you know both of the individual kanji meanings, you should be able to put together this one to get five machines. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
137 | 外人 | がいじん | Foreigner | Outsider | An "outside person" is a foreigner. This word is fairly common, though it's not super polite, either. It's okay most of the time, but it can be used derogatorily depending on the situation. The more polite version is 外国人 (outside country person) but you won't learn that until you learn the kanji for 国. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nWho's the foreigner? Well obviously the guy wearing jeans (がいじん)!
138 | フランス人 | ふらんすじん | French Person | Frenchman | フランス is "France." So what is a "France person?" That would be a French Person. \n Often times, when two kanji come together to form a kanji compound (or jukugo), you use the on'yomi readings. This is similar to that, though instead of another kanji it's a foreign word. This pattern works with almost any country as well. Just add 人 to a country name and you've described the people who live there. You'll see more of these before you're finished here.\nAnd since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nAs with all words for nationalities, the 人 here is pronounced じん. Like people of all other nationalities, a French person loves their jeans (じん) too!
139 | 生 | なま | Fresh | Raw\n Live | Normally a single kanji alone like this would mean the same thing as its parent kanji, but in the case of 生 it's a little different (but still related). When you think of something that has life, it's fresh or raw. Think sashimi or sushi, for example. You want that to be as close as possible to life as you can, so you eat it when it's fresh and raw. This word can also be used to describe a live event, like a concert or sporting event.\nYou'll see this word at the beginning of other words. For example, 生たまご is "raw egg." \n This uses one of the kun'yomi readings. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\nAfter eating raw fish, my yoga teacher and I say namaste (なま) to the sushi chef, bowing low to show our appreciation.
140 | 友人 | ゆうじん | Friend |  | A person who is a friend is just that, a friend!\nNote that 友人 is a more formal word that’s often used in professional settings. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nAll your friends are youths in jeans (ゆうじん)! Every single one. If any of your friends is not a youth in jeans, they're simply not your friend, I'm afraid.
141 | 毛 | け | Fur | Hair | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nLook down! You're holding something covered in fur. It's a furry kettle (け)! It's the weirdest kettle you've ever seen, but presumably it keeps the water hot for much longer.
142 | 少女 | しょうじょ | Girl | Young Girl | A little woman is a girl.\n少女 is a relatively formal word that's often used in writing to describe a young girl, usually between childhood and adolescence (or between the ages of about five and eighteen). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
143 | 半分 | はんぶん | Half |  | You have half a part. Half a part is still half, right? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
144 | 半 | はん | Half |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it's supposed to use the kun'yomi reading. But, there is no useful kun'yomi reading for this kanji, so even the single kanji vocab word version uses the on'yomi reading, which you've already learned!
145 | 心 | こころ | Heart | Mind\n Feeling | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nImagine a giant heart sitting in a rowing boat. It's also drinking cocoa. Focus on all three of these parts and associate them into one story / memory. Once you've done that, sing the "cocoa row" (こころ) song! I don't know what that song is, but I want you to make one up and actually sing it, out loud. If you do, I bet you won't forget this word's reading too easily.
146 | こんにちは | こんにちは | Hello | Good afternoon | Connie Chihuahua (こんにちは) says hello. Connie Chihuahua is an amazing talking chihuahua. She can only say "hello", but that alone is pretty impressive.\nこんにちは is a formal way to say "hello". It’s generally used during the daytime, from late morning to early evening. Watch out for the は on the end, which is always pronounced わ.
147 | 大切 | たいせつ | Important | Precious\n Valuable | Think back to the old old olden days. Back when decisions were made with swords. A big cut is going to be important. Just imagine a couple samurai squaring off, then charging, then making one big cut. It's the most important thing they'll do in their lives (if they live!). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nIt's extremely important to keep your ties in sets (たいせつ). If you don't arrange them neatly in sets, the tie police might just come knocking at your door and take you with them!
148 | 内 | うち | Inside | Within | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nWhen this kanji is a word on its own, it's actually very often written in hiragana. Still, the kanji version of the word is worth knowing, too! \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThere's something inside and you wanna get to what's within. Look inside. Ooh, cheese (うち)! Your favorite. Ooh cheese, how I love you.
149 | 戸 | と | Japanese Style Door | Door | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
150 | ビー玉 | びーだま | Marble |  | When you see a katakana word, it's a safe bet that it is a foreign loan word from somewhere else. This one's interesting, because it combines katakana and kanji! The first marble came to Japan from Portugal, so the ビー part of the word is short for "vidro," which means "glass" in Portuguese. Anyway, don't get thrown off by that ビー. Maybe just imagine that your favorite marble is black and yellow like a bee. \n If you know katakana as well as the reading that you learned when you learned the kanji 玉, you should be able to read this. Just watch out for the rendaku.
151 | 母 | はは | Mother | Mom | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is the polite and humble form of mother. You use this when you're talking about your own mother to other people, especially if you aren't very close to them. \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading, but this is the reading you learned with the kanji. Just remember, your mother is a terrible person and won't stop laughing at you: "HA HA HA HA HA!"
152 | お母さん | おかあさん | Mother | Mom | This word starts with お which makes it more polite. Then, there's the kanji 母 which you know means mother. Last, there's the honorific さん which further adds respect (to the mother). So, this is the nice way to say mother. You use it when you're talking to your own mom or talking about her with friends. You can also use this when you're talking about your friends' moms.\nIf you need to talk about someone's mother that you don't really know, or you aren't close to, you'll want to use お母様, instead. Don't worry, you'll learn that last kanji in a few lessons. Until then, it's pronounced, おかあさま. Kay? \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. You have to remember the かあ portion. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it:\nWhat does your super nice mother do for you (this is why you're so polite to her!)? She drives you all around in her car (かあ) taking you wherever you need to go... soccer, kendo, whatever. What a nice mother you have!
153 | 市立 | しりつ | Municipal | City | The city stand is municipal in nature. Municipal means "of or relating to a city or its governing body", and this vocabulary means just that. Or just city. City is fine too. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
154 | 北 | きた | North |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou're going to the far north where it's very cold (north pole, perhaps?). One of the most important things you bring with you is a survival kit (きた).
155 | 今 | いま | Now |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nWhat'll you drink now? I'll have a Zima, ima.\nSay "ZIMA IMA" ten times fast.
156 | 〜人 | にん | Number Of People | People\n Counter For People | When you see this on a number, for example ７人 or ３人, you're using it to count people. Just remember, both 一人 and 二人 have alternative readings. From 3 and up it's just the number plus にん, like this. ５人 is ごにん, １０人 is じゅうにん, etc. This is the counter for people, which makes this word the number of people. \n This is a counter, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nJust think of the sheer number of people at Nintendo (にん). It must be huge. This really is just a counter for people that work at Nintendo.
157 | 大人しい | おとなしい | Obedient | Quiet\n Calm | Remember how you learned that 大人 means "adult?" Well this is the adjective version of that. The I-adjective (see how it ends in い?). What adjective do adults want to be able to use for their own kids? They want to say they are obedient, quiet kids! \n You already learned this reading when you learned 大人! You should be able to read this too!
158 | 古い | ふるい | Old | Ancient\n Out-Of-Date | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of old? It's also old, ancient, or out-of-date.\nThis word is used for things like clothes, food and friendships, but not for people! So a 古い友人 (old friend) is someone you've been friends with for a long time, not an elderly friend. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji with some hiragana attached, it's going to use the kun'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi when learning the kanji portion, so let's use a mnemonic to help you with the reading of this word:\nIf you're old, you're also full (ふる) of memories. And you're probably full of old secrets. And you're full from old people food.
159 | 十万 | じゅうまん | One Hundred Thousand | Hundred Thousand | Ten ten thousands is equal to one hundred thousand. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
160 | 一台 | いちだい | One Machine |  | As long as you know the two kanji that make up this word, you should be able to figure out the meaning of this word as well. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
161 | 人生 | じんせい | One's Life | Human Life\n Life | The kanji for person and life combined makes you think about human life. What is your human life like? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 and 生 both have two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYour life boils down to just two things: jeans and a saber (じんせい). Your whole life, that's all you've ever needed, jeans and a saber. What are you, some kind of American pirate?
162 | テーブルの上 | てーぶるのうえ | On The Table | Tabletop | First we have a katakana word, so it's safe to assume that it's a loan word. Like many loan words, it comes from English. Say it out loud and what do you have? That's right, "table". Then comes the particle の, which joins two nouns together. Finally we have 上, which you learned means "up" or "above". Put all of these pieces together and we have a phrase meaning on the table or tabletop! \n In this phrase, 上 is a standalone word, so it uses the same reading that you learned when you learned the vocabulary. Easy to stay on top of that one, right?
163 | 外 | そと | Outside |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou look outside, it's totally frozen. You throw salt (そと) outside to melt the ice.
164 | 分 | ぶん | Part | Portion\n Content | This word has the same meaning that you learned with the kanji: part, or portion. By extension, it can also mean content, as in "alcohol content" because that's the portion of alcohol in a drink.\nThis word is used for fractions, too, as in one third or one quarter. Again, you can see how this links to "parts" and "portions", right? \n This word is usually combined with a word or phrase indicating whose part or portion you’re referring to. That’s probably why this single kanji vocab word uses the on’yomi instead of the kun’yomi reading. Check out the common word combinations to see what we’re talking about!\nAnd when it means part or portion, it's read ぶん. Probably because your buns come in two parts. Ohoho.
165 | シアトル市 | しあとるし | Seattle | City Of Seattle | The name of the city (シアトル／しあとる) with a 市 attached to it means it is "the city of ____." You can do this with any city (try it out on your hometown!). So this word means Seattle, or more specifically City of Seattle. \n This word uses on'yomi reading, which you learned with the kanji.
166 | 中古 | ちゅうこ | Secondhand | Used | The combination of kanji doesn't make perfect sense, but it's alright. Take something that's middle old and you have something that's used or secondhand. It's not 100% old yet... it's still in the middle, meaning you can give it to someone else to use, like your younger siblings. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
167 | 日の出 | ひので | Sunrise |  | What do we call the sun's exit from the horizon? That'll be the sunrise. Imagine the sun exiting the horizon and climbing up into the sky. \n This uses the kanji's kun'yomi readings, which you've already learned. As long as you remember those, you should be good to go!
168 | 中止 | ちゅうし | Suspension | Cancellation\n Discontinuation | When something is in the middle of an action but it's stopped, this means it's put into suspension. Imagine getting frozen while you're running. It's kind of like that. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
169 | 用 | よう | Task | Use\n Duty\n Service\n Business\n Purpose | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This one uses the on'yomi reading, which you've learned from the kanji already!
170 | 十台 | じゅうだい | Ten Machines |  | If you know the two kanji separately, you should be able to put them together to form the meaning of this kanji. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
171 | 一万 | いちまん | Ten Thousand |  | When you have one ten thousand you just have ten thousand. In Japanese, though, you specify how many ten thousands you have, though (which is weird in English, but should make sense if you think about it). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
172 | 万 | まん | Ten Thousand |  | When a vocab word is a single kanji without okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually has the same meaning as the kanji it's spawned from. If you know the kanji meaning you'll also know the vocab meaning. It's ten thousand! \n When a vocab word is a single kanji with no okurigana, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception to this. Numbers use the on'yomi reading, which you've already learned by learning the kanji's reading! How nice!
173 | 今月 | こんげつ | This Month | Current Month | The now month is actually this month. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 月 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nOnly this month, your pet condor gets (こんげつ) to sleep in your bed. You usually keep it in a cage, but once a year, you make an exception. And that's this month. How cute!
174 | これ | これ | This One | These Ones | Collect (これ) this one right here! Go ahead, collect this one.\nYou can use これ to talk about anything that's close to you. Things that are close to you are easy to collect, after all!
175 | 生まれる | うまれる | To Be Born |  | Since this is a kanji with hiragana attached that ends with an う sound, you know that this word is a verb. What's the ultimate verb version of the kanji 生? That would be to be born, the very beginning of life as we know it! \n You have to remember the う part of this word to read it. To remember that, let's use a mnemonic:\nSomething is about to be born, and when you lean in for a closer look… it’s an uni (う). Yes, a sea urchin. You weren’t expecting that. Close your eyes and imagine what the process of an uni being born might look like, to help you remember this reading.
176 | 切る | きる | To Cut |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means cut, and the verb form of that is to cut. \n When you think to cut something, what do you think about cutting? One thing is cutting down a tree, which is also known as 木, or き. You きる a き.
177 | 今日 | きょう | Today |  | The now day is what day? Oh, it's today. \n The reading for this word is a complete exception, though the word itself is incredibly common and useful. When you think of "today" think about what you have to do today for work.\nYou have to work in one of those mall kiosks (きょう). Just think about how sad you are that you have to do this today. What a crummy day. It's sunny outside and you're stuck in a mall manning this hermit crab kiosk.\nNote: This reading mnemonic is pretty far away from the actual reading, as far as reading mnemonics go. Use this to get yourself close, and then use your own brain grapes to get the rest of the way there. This one won't be as easy as most of the others, but do some good old fashioned memorization and you should be okay. I won't ask you to do this much, fortunately. :)
178 | する | する | To Do |  | It's only through (する) doing things that we get better at them, so you need to do them as much as you can.\nする basically means to do, but it’s incredibly versatile and goes beyond its English equivalent. Besides being used alone, it can be put together with a whole range of nouns to turn them into verbs. We call these する verbs and you'll learn a lot of them as we go along!
179 | 太る | ふとる | To Get Fat | To Gain Weight\n To Grow Fat\n To Become Fat | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means fat so the verb form of that is to get fat. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You have to learn the ふと portion of this word to be able to read it. Here'a mnemonic to help you:\nIt's easy to get fat if you're always in your futon (ふと).
180 | 引く | ひく | To Pull | To Withdraw | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means pull and the verb version vocab means to pull.\nThis word can be transitive or intransitive. You use 引く in a transitive way to say you pull something, for example. But it can also mean to withdraw when you talk about things that pull back, like water that recedes, pain that subsides, soldiers that withdraw, or even your body recoiling when something puts you off. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. The reading (ひ) is the same as the one you learned for the kanji, meaning you should already know it!
181 | 広げる | ひろげる | To Spread Something | To Unfold Something\n To Open Something Up | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means wide, and the verb version is what happens when you try to make something wider. How do you make something wider? That's right, you have to spread something, to unfold something or to open something up. All of those actions will make a thing wider!\nThis is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You spread something. Like a newspaper, or a cloth on a table. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji, but here's a reminder mnemonic to help you:\nYou are going to spread something. What are you going to spread? How about your arms, so that you can fly into the sky like the super hero (ひろ) that you are! Most heroes can fly when they spread their arms wide!
182 | 止める | とめる | To Stop Something | To Prevent Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means stop and the verb vocab version of that is to stop something.\nThis particular word is when you're stopping something (i.e. doing the action of stopping it). \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou need to stop something from moving. Maybe a car... or a door... or a person... whatever you want. To stop this thing, you throw out your toe (と), getting it smashed in the process. Imagine it bleeding and swelling up. How much it hurts! You put your toe out to stop this big thing, what a mistake!
183 | 用いる | もちいる | To Utilize | To Use | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means task or use. You can think of this verb as a more formal way to say to use, and that is to utilize. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to learn the もち portion of もちいる:\nWhat will you utilize to get the job done? You have mochi (もち) in your hand, so you'll use that. Now go think of some kind of imaginary task you'll complete with mochi, making it as ridiculous as possible.
184 | 二万 | にまん | Twenty Thousand |  | When you have two ten thousands, you have twenty thousand. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
185 | 二台 | にだい | Two Machines |  | When you combine these two kanji, you should be able to see how it forms the word two machines. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
186 | ベッドの下 | べっどのした | Under The Bed | Below The Bed\n Beneath The Bed | This starts with another katakana word, so you can assume that it's a loan word. This one also comes from English. Can you figure out what it means? That's right, "bed". Then comes the particle の, which joins two nouns together. Finally, we have 下, which you learned means "down" or "below". Put these elements together and you get below the bed, under the bed or beneath the bed. What's under your bed? \n 下 is a standalone word here, so it uses the same reading that you learned when you learned the vocabulary.
187 | 方 | かた | Way | Direction | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading, but it can be either that or the on'yomi reading, depending on the context. You haven't learned the kun'yomi reading for 方 yet, so there's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou need to go a certain direction. How do you get there? By jumping into a catapult (かた) and shooting yourself the right way. Need to get a particular direction fast? Consider the catapult next time.
188 | いつ | いつ | When |  | He eats (いつ) and eats and eats. When does this guy not eat?\nいつ is a question word that is used to ask when.
189 | 広い | ひろい | Wide | Spacious | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of wide? It's also wide. \n The reading for this word is the same as the reading you learned in the kanji section: ひろ, making this ひろい.
190 | 冬 | ふゆ | Winter |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this word is the same as the kun'yomi reading you learned for the kanji, meaning you should know both!
191 | 女の人 | おんなのひと | Woman |  | A woman person is a woman.\nThe の particle here means the first noun is modifying the second one, so you can probably see why 女の人 (a woman person) really just means woman! It's more polite than saying 女 by itself, so that's all you have to remember. \n This word is actually two separate words combined with a particle. So, since you treat them like separate words, you read each of them with the kun'yomi readings (they are both single kanji words all alone). That being said, in level 1 you learned about the vocab readings for these separate words, so use that knowledge to remember the reading for this word as well.
192 | 他人 | たにん | Another Person | Other People\n Stranger | When you have an other person, you really have another person.\n他人 has a sense of unfamiliarity or distance, and suggests that the person isn’t well-known, or is different from you or a specific group of people. It doesn't usually mean "another person" in the sense of an additional person, or another person distinct from the one you’re talking about. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nAnother person just stole your taco and your Nintendo (たにん). This complete stranger just walked up and took your taco and your Nintendo console straight out of your hands. Yoink.
193 | 早々 | そうそう | As Soon As | Just After\n Immediately After\n Quickly\n Early | Essentially you have the kanji 早 twice, because 々 is just a repeater kanji. When you have something early twice, it obviously has some kind of urgency to it. You'll need to take an action as soon as you finish whatever it is you're doing there. \n The reading is just the on'yomi readings (which you learned with the kanji) twice in a row.
194 | 大気 | たいき | Atmosphere |  | If there is a big energy it's going to fill up the atmosphere! Think about big energies you feel in the atmosphere: thunderstorms, tornadoes, the aurora borealis. Just remember, this is the atmosphere in the sky, not the atmosphere in a fancy restaurant. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nImagine an atmosphere consisting entirely of ties and keys (たいき), floating around. The ties are getting tangled together, and the keys keep bashing you on the head. Bring back the normal atmosphere, this one's horrible.
195 | 赤ちゃん | あかちゃん | Baby |  | ちゃん is the honorific you put on a child's name. So, who is this mysterious child you're calling red? When a baby is born, what color are they? You got it, they're all red. And, because you want to be nice and cute you add ちゃん to that. That's why あかちゃん is a baby. \n If you know the reading of the kanji 赤 you should know the reading of this too.
196 | 竹 | たけ | Bamboo |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well! \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading which is also the reading you associated with the kanji, earlier.
197 | 竹の子 | たけのこ | Bamboo Shoot | Bamboo Sprout | What is bamboo’s child? That would be a baby bamboo. Because "baby bamboo" doesn't really make sense, we'll instead call this word bamboo shoots.\nWhen this is written as 竹の子, the bamboo shoots are probably still growing in the ground. If they’re picked and cooked and ready to eat, the pronunciation is the same, but it’s usually written in other forms, such as タケノコ. \n If you know the readings of the kanji for 竹 and the vocabulary for 子 you should be able to read this word as well.
198 | 少年 | しょうねん | Boy | Young Boy\n Youth | Someone of few years is someone who's young. Since we already have 少女 for girls, 少年 means boy.\n少年 is a bit of a formal term that often refers to a young boy, usually between childhood and adolescence, or sometimes to a youth in general. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
199 | 虫 | むし | Bug | Insect\n Creepy Crawly | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This word is actually more general than the English words insect and bug, though. It covers things like worms and spiders, too, so in that sense it's more like creepy-crawly. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading, which is also the reading you learned when you learned this kanji!
200 | 年内 | ねんない | By The End Of The Year | Before The End Of This Year\n Within The Year | Inside the year means by the end of the year. In other words, before the end of this year, or within the year. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
201 | 子牛 | こうし | Calf | Baby Cow | You have a child cow. What do you think a child cow is? Probably a calf or a baby cow. \n Since you should know the readings of the words 子 and 牛 from the previous level, you should be able to read this word too even though it's using the kun'yomi readings for the kanji.
202 | 平気 | へいき | Calm | Cool\n All Right\n Okay | You have a flat energy. What kind of energy would be a flat one? Probably a cool or calm one. You'd also tell people about this flat energy by saying you are all right or just okay. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
203 | 車 | くるま | Car |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou visit your mom who lives inside of a car. It's sad, and you feel bad. The first thing that pops out of your mouth is: "Cool Room, Ma (くるま) because you don't know what else to say about your ma's living situation.\nBe sure to sort of cut off the last letters of the first two words... something like "coo' roo' ma!" Sad thing is, there is only one room in this car your mom calls home.
204 | 中央 | ちゅうおう | Center | Central\n Centre | The middle of the central... that is really, really in the center if you ask me (and is very central as well). This is one of those "overdid it on the meaning" words. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
205 | 耳 | みみ | Ear | Ears | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading which is the reading you learned with the kanji. So you should be able to read this word already.
206 | 早い | はやい | Early | Fast\n Quick | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of early? It's also early. \n The reading for this word is the kun'yomi reading, which you did not learn when you learned the kanji. You have to remember the はや portion to be able to read this word. In order to do that, here's a mnemonic:\nYou're fast! You're early! Your chop comes down onto your opponent's neck so quickly! As you chop him, you yell "はや!"
207 | 元気 | げんき | Energy | Health\n Energetic\n Healthy | What is the origin of your energy? It is your health. This word also means energy, and when it's used as an adjective it means healthy or energetic. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
208 | 名人 | めいじん | Expert | Master | A person whose name is known (because he's famous?). Why is this person's name known? Why is this person famous? It's because they are an expert / master at something. How else does someone become famous or well-known? That's pretty much it, even if they're just an expert at being an idiot. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nDid you know that every expert has their own pair of May jeans (めいじん)? A true master of anything has a specific pair of jeans they wear only in the month of May. That's what makes them so good at what they do.
209 | 気分 | きぶん | Feeling | Mood | Part of your energy is your feeling or your mood. Just think of it like you're breaking up your energy into parts. One part is sugar giving you energy. Another part is your happiness. So, when you combine these together you get the total: your mood! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
210 | 花火 | はなび | Fireworks |  | The flower fire... what looks like flowers on fire? That would be fireworks. Totally makes sense, right? \n The readings for the kanji that make this word are the kun'yomi readings, where fire's ひ changes to び. You already learned the kun'yomi reading for 花 when you learned the kanji, so it's only a matter of remembering to use the kun'yomi for 火. If you do, you should be able to read this word.
211 | 先ず | まず | First Of All | To Start With\n Firstly\n To Begin With | The kanji means previous. This is an adverb version of that word. It's a little thing you can begin sentences with. You can't start your sentences with "previous" but you can start it with "First of all" or "to start with."\nThis is usually written without kanji though, so keep that in mind. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. In fact, the reading for this word is very rare, and kind of an exception. We'll use a mnemonic that uses both the kanji part and the hiragana attachment part.\nFirst of all and to start with, you have to make it through this maze (まず).
212 | 一年生 | いちねんせい | First Year Student |  | You'd maybe think this just means one year of life, but it actually means first year student. A second year student is a 二年生, and so on. Just think about how crazy the Japanese are about school. You can see why school is life, and not life itself, making this vocab word "first year student." \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
213 | 五百 | ごひゃく | Five Hundred |  | When you have five hundreds you also have five hundred. \n This word uses the on'yomi readings for both kanji, so you should be able to read it already!
214 | 平ら | たいら | Flat |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same with a little hiragana sticking out. Because the hiragana doesn't really indicate what it is, it's okay to assume that they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a kanji plus some hiragana attached, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nSomething is very, very flat. Perhaps someone who doesn't eat much, like a model? Which model? Let's imagine it's Tyra (たいら) Banks.
215 | 花 | はな | Flower |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. This is the reading you learned when you learned the kanji, so you're good to go. Don't forget to stop and smell the roses on the way, though.
216 | 足 | あし | Foot | Leg | The kanji and the word are almost exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. A foot is a foot, you know? \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nIf you remember in the radical/kanji mnemonic, you kick someone with your foot. But what happens after you kick them? Turns out they were made of fire, and you just burned your foot off, turning it to ashes (あし). Imagine this happening.
217 | 四十 | よんじゅう | Forty |  | What do you get when you have four tens? You get forty. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. The only exception to this is 四, which uses the kun'yomi reading, since the on'yomi reading sounds too much like the word for "death." Luckily you know these reading already, so there's nothing new to learn!
218 | 四百 | よんひゃく | Four Hundred |  | When you have four hundreds, you have four hundred. \n This word has number four in it, and uses the kun'yomi reading for that kanji (よん). The reading for 百 though, is the on'yomi reading (ひゃく). This is pretty normal when it comes to words containing four in Japanese. You know both of these readings already. Hooray!
219 | 四日 | よっか | Fourth Day | Day Four\n Four Days | Fourth day or day four. No matter how you look at this combination of kanji, the meaning of the word makes a lot of sense! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Counting days, however, is an exception (at least up to ten). You need to use the kun'yomi readings to read this word. You already know the kun'yomi reading for 四, so that's fine (the ん gets turned into a small っ, though). Think of it this way:\nOn the fourth day of being lost in the wilderness, you start yelling "Yo, car (よっか)!" out of desperation, never getting an answer. You keep marching on, occasionally yelling "Yo, car!", but no car ever comes to help you.
220 | 四つ | よっつ | Four Things |  | Any number with a つ attached is a word that means "NUMBER Things." In this case, it's four things. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can assume it uses the kun'yomi reading. The ん part of よん gets converted to a small っ though, so watch out for that.
221 | 四千 | よんせん | Four Thousand |  | You have four and you have thousand. Multiply them together and you have four thousand. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. That's true for the 千 part, but the 四 reading is kun'yomi. You should know how to read this word as long as you've been studying your kanji!
222 | さようなら | さようなら | Goodbye |  | I saw your Nara (さようなら), but I then had to say goodbye. It was just a short trip, but at least I saw your Nara.\nさようなら is a formal way to say goodbye, so a good word to use with colleagues and teachers.\nA quick tip before I say goodbye: さようなら often drops its middle う, becoming さよなら.
223 | こんばんは | こんばんは | Good Evening |  | Con ban, wah! (こんばんは) cries your friend, just as you say good evening. There's a report on the evening news about a con ban (yes, that's a ban on conning people). Wah! Exciting stuff.\nYou can use こんばんは as a greeting from around 5pm or 6pm, in both formal and informal situations.　Watch out for that は on the end, which is pronounced わ here too.
224 | 主人 | しゅじん | Head Of Household | Husband\n Head Of A Household\n Head Of The Household\n Landlord\n Master | The master person isn't just a master. You have to think back to when they were making these kanji. Who was the master? It was the head of household. This head of household probably told servants what to do and was all bossy and stuff. He was the master person.\nAlso, this often means husband. Because, I guess the head of household back in the day was the husband. Those sexist ancient people! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nIn Japan, tradition says the head of a household must slide down a chute in only jeans (しゅじん). Whenever you need to speak to the head of the household, they'll come sliding down a chute wearing nothing but jeans. What a sight!
225 | 穴 | あな | Hole |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading you learned with the kanji is the same as the reading for this word. No holes in your knowledge!
226 | 休日 | きゅうじつ | Holiday |  | When you have a rest day you have a holiday. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 日 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nEvery holiday, you eat not one, but two cucumbers. Gee, two (きゅうじつ)? Take it easy!
227 | 百 | ひゃく | Hundred | One Hundred | When a vocab word is a single kanji without okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually has the same meaning as the kanji it's spawned from. If you know the kanji meaning you'll also know the vocab meaning. It's one hundred! \n When a vocab word is a single kanji with no okurigana, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception to this. Numbers use the on'yomi reading, which you've already learned by learning the kanji's reading! How nice!
228 | 氷 | こおり | Ice |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading which is what you learned with the kanji.
229 | 丸ごと | まるごと | In Its Entirety | Whole\n Wholly\n Entirely | If you go to (ごと) a circle, you need to go to it in its entirety. That means you have to circle around the whole thing. Otherwise, it isn't even a circle. It's like a line or a squiggle or something.\nYou often hear this word when talking about food – like when biting into a whole apple or accidentally swallowing a grape without chewing. But it's not just for food: you can also use it to talk about memorizing a whole book from beginning to end, for example. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading, so you should be able to read this too!
230 | 不正 | ふせい | Injustice | Dishonest\n Unauthorized | When you have something that's not correct, you have no justice. In fact, you have injustice. Just imagine yourself being put in an unjust situation, and think about how not correct it is. It's probably dishonest and unauthorized too. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
231 | 車内 | しゃない | Inside The Car | Inside The Train\n Inside The Bus | The car inside is simply that, inside the car. This can be used for other means of transport too, so it can also mean inside the train or inside the bus. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
232 | 宝石 | ほうせき | Jewel | Gem | A treasure stone is a very valuable stone. What kind of stones are considered treasures? How about a jewel, or a gem? \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
233 | 先月 | せんげつ | Last Month |  | The previous month is last month. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 月 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nAs of last month, your centaur gets (せんげつ) up every night and comes to sleep in your bed. Apparently, he gets really bad nightmares. Poor little centaur.
234 | 去年 | きょねん | Last Year |  | The past year is just last year. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
235 | 左手 | ひだりて | Left Hand | Left Arm\n Left-Hand Side | Your left hand is your left hand! This word can also be used to mean left arm, and left-hand side. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. This word, however, uses the kun'yomi readings. This is possibly because of 手, because body parts often use kun'yomi. You learned both readings with the individual words, so you should be able to read this.
236 | 文字 | もじ | Letter (Of The Alphabet) | Character\n Letter\n Text | A writing letter is simpler than it sounds. It's really just a letter, right? You're reading 文字 right now, in fact! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. The reading of 文 is a bit of an exception here. It uses a shortened version of the on'yomi もん, which is も. Here's a mnemonic to remember this:\nYou know all the letters of the alphabet only because of Moe (も). If it wasn't for your buddy Moe teaching you all the letters, you probably wouldn't even be able to read today. Thanks Moe!
237 | 主に | おもに | Mainly | Primarily | 主 means main so when you add に it becomes the adverb mainly. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou mainly spend your time talking to your master Moe. But you mainly address him like, "Oh Moe The Great!" (おも). That's because he's above you. Imagine yourself saying "OH MOE THE GREAT!" as you walk into his room, bowing low.
238 | 男 | おとこ | Man |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nJust be aware that this word used alone can sound a bit rude. You'll learn a more neutral option very soon. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it:\nThere is a man. Think of the manliest man you can. He works in an auto shop. As a child, he was an auto 子 (おとこ), working at the auto shop from an early age. This turned him into a man very quickly.\nLike other mnemonics that aren't lined up quite perfectly, your goal here is to get close enough to remember the true reading. Step, step, step, jump!
239 | 仕方 | しかた | Method | Way\n Way Of Doing | The doing way is basically a "way of doing" something. More simply put, this is the method. "What's your way of doing this?" No no no. "What's your METHOD." There we go. \n This word uses the on'yomi reading for the first kanji 仕, and the kun'yomi reading for the second kanji 方, so watch out for that! You've learned both of these readings already, so you should be able to read this!
240 | 百万 | ひゃくまん | Million | One Million | one hundred ten thousands is how much? Multiply the two together and you get a million. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
241 | 先々月 | せんせんげつ | Month Before Last | The Month Before Last | The previous previous month (remember that 々 just repeats the kanji before it) is the month before last. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
242 | 月見 | つきみ | Moon Viewing |  | When you moon see something, you're doing a moon viewing. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. For 見 you already learned the kun'yomi reading when you learned the kanji. For 月 you'll have to think back to the vocab word 月 which uses the つき reading. Combine these two together and you have つきみ.
243 | 名 | な | Name | Reputation | This vocabulary word is the same as the 'name' meaning of the kanji. If you can remember that, you'll have no trouble remembering this word as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Just think of the first part of the English word name. What is it? It's na (な), just like this word!
244 | ノート | ノート | Notebook | Notes | ノート is a shortened form of notebook, with an extra "o" on the end since you can’t end a word with "t" in Japanese.\nYou can also use this to mean notes, in the context of taking down notes in a class.
245 | 号 | ごう | Number | Edition\n Model | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nThis word is generally added to the end of a number, as in 三号 ("number 3"). It can also go together with other words to give things like train car numbers, as in ２号車 ("car 2"), and room numbers. When used on its own, it indicates the edition number of magazines and the like. \n This word is made up of a single kanji all alone, but it uses the on'yomi reading. This is probably because you'll usually see this word attached to other things, like numbers. This shows the edition or number of an item. So, even though it's alone, it's usually used like jukugo, which is why the reading for this one is the same as the reading you learned when you learned the kanji.
246 | 一気 | いっき | One Breath | One Go\n One Sitting | It's weird to think of having one energy. But, what gives you energy? You do it one time every couple of seconds. That would be taking breaths. So, "one energy" is one breath. \n The reading is the same as the ones you learned with the individual kanji, though いち from 一 is shortened to いっ.
247 | 一打 | いちだ | One Hit |  | One hit is simply… one hit!\n一打 refers to a single impactful strike. It's often a hit in ball sports, but can also be a punch in boxing or a button tap in video games. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
248 | 他 | ほか | Other |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou need to go for a drive to the public gardens, but you aren't going to get your normal car, you're going to get your other car. Your hoe car (ほか)! It's a car made entirely out of garden hoes. You can drive it and hoe with it at the same time! Your other car can't do that!
249 | 休止 | きゅうし | Pause | Hiatus | A stop that's just a rest (aka not permanent) isn't a straight up stop. You're planning on continuing again. That's why this is a pause, suspension, or hiatus.\nThis is a fairly formal word, and it's often used when an activity or a service is temporarily suspended. For example, you could use it to talk about a class being suspended, a machine suspending its operation, or a pop band going on a hiatus. Check out our common word combinations below for more example usages. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
250 | 皿 | さら | Plate | Dish | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading which is also the reading you learned when you learned the kanji.
251 | 人気 | にんき | Popular | Popularity | If a person has a lot of energy then they're very charismatic and fun! What's another feature of charismatic / fun people? They are most likely popular as well. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 and 気 both have two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou're so popular that you've been given the Nintendo key (にんき). That's right, Nintendo gave you the master key to their entire office. Just like that.\nThis is a lot of responsibility even for your levels of popularity, so be careful not to lose this key!
252 | 切手 | きって | Postage Stamp | Stamp | This is a pretty old word, and in the olden days, everything was cut by hand, including postage stamps. Having to cut thousands of stamps each day by hand sounds incredibly laborious, so maybe that's why this word came to be associated specifically with stamps. \n You'd think that the reading for this would consist of the on'yomi readings, but human body parts (hand) do funny things to words. In this case, it's the kun'yomi readings of both the kanji. You should know the kun'yomi reading for 切 and 手 from the previous levels, meaning you should be able to remember the reading for this word fairly easily. Watch out for the small っ, though.
253 | 赤い | あかい | Red |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of red? Why, it's red! \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
254 | 赤 | あか | Red |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
255 | 休み | やすみ | Rest | Break\n Vacation\n Holiday | The kanji rest has a little hiragana attached, but it's nothing that would suggest it's anything but a noun (it is!). It means the same thing as the kanji, rest. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji with some hiragana, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nSo, do you want a rest from work or school? You should say "YAASS (やす)!"
256 | 右手 | みぎて | Right Hand | Right Arm\n Right-Hand Side | Your right hand is your right hand! This word can also be used to mean right arm, and right-hand side. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. This word, however, uses the kun'yomi readings. This is possibly because of 手, because body parts often use kun'yomi. You learned both readings with the individual words, so you should be able to read this.
257 | 二世 | にせい | Second Generation |  | The two generation is the second generation. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
258 | 本気 | ほんき | Serious | Seriousness | What is book energy? It is energy you put into reading - it is your studies! In order to have book energy, though, you have to be very serious. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
259 | かき氷 | かきごおり | Shaved Ice |  | This is かき ice, which is shaved ice. \n The reading for 氷 is the same as the one you learned (こおり) except it gets converted to ごおり because it comes after かき, so it's rendaku'd.
260 | 貝 | かい | Shell | Shellfish\n Clam | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, meaning you should be able to read this already.
261 | 不足 | ふそく | Shortage | Insufficiency | You have something that's not sufficient. When something isn't sufficient, you have an insufficiency or shortage.\nThis word is more commonly used in formal contexts. In more casual, everyday conversations, 足りない is often preferred to express something being insufficient. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
262 | 一本気 | いっぽんぎ | One-Track Mind | Single Mindedness | You have only one book energy. No other books cross your mind. Only this one book. Why? Because you have such a one-track mind. \n The reading is based off the on'yomi readings for everything, though every reading is slightly altered. いち getting shortened to いっ, ほん changing to ぽん, and き gets changed to ぎ. They're based off the readings you know already, though, so making this shift shouldn't be too hard... that is, unless you have an 一本気, ammiright?
263 | 小皿 | こざら | Small Plate | Small Dish\n Little Plate\n Little Dish | You have a small plate. Wait, is that it? Yep, that's it. \n さら uses the same reading as the one you learned with the kanji, except it's ざら this time because of the rendaku. 小 uses an alternate kun'yomi reading. You can remember it by thinking "What are small? Kids (子) are small. Bwahaha."
264 | 気 | き | Spirit | Energy | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the kanji that makes up this word. Lucky you!

266 | 一文字 | いちもんじ | Straight Line |  | When you have one writing letter what do you have? Here's a hint, there's one kanji in this word that consists of one writing letter (aka a straight line). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 文 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nStraight lines are for monsters (もん). Only a monster would ever draw a perfectly straight line. You're no monster, so no straight lines for you!
267 | 名字 | みょうじ | Surname | Last Name\n Family Name | A name written in letters is the surname. Back in the day your surname was the important name (it's your family name after all, and family was king back in the day). This is the name you'd write out in kanji... aka in letters. So, that's why this combination of kanji means "surname." \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.\nNote that the 名 portion is the alternate reading, so adjust your thinking accordingly so you can get to みょう. Just imagine someone saying "more" with a funny accent. They say "myou" instead of "more". Imagine them saying they have myou people in their family than yours. Their surname is spread amongst myou people than yours.
268 | 先生 | せんせい | Teacher | Sensei | Previous life... So we're talking about someone who has a previous life, or maybe previous life experience? When you have previous life experience, you can teach others about it, making you qualified to be some kind of teacher.\n先生 is often used for school teachers, but it's also used to show respect to doctors, lawyers, authors, and other respected experts.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
269 | テレビ | テレビ | Television | TV | テレビ comes from the English word television. It’s been shortened, which is really common with loanwords in Japanese. The "vi" sound becomes ビ, too.\nテレビ is sometimes written as "TV", but even then it’s usually pronounced テレビ.
270 | お礼 | おれい | Thanks | Gratitude | The meaning of this word is the same as the kanji, except it has an お before it, which just makes the thing you're saying elevate the other person more. Basically, it's more polite and awesome. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
271 | 先日 | せんじつ | The Other Day | A Few Days Ago\n Other Day | The previous day isn't necessarily yesterday. It can be any recent day, which is why this word means the other day. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 日 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nThe other day, you saw two centaurs! Gee, two (せんじつ) of them?! You're lucky you're still alive!
272 | 三世 | さんせい | Third Generation |  | The three generation is the third generation. Depending on the context, you can sometimes use this alone to say you're third generation Japanese. Usually, though, you'll want to specify whether you're third generation Japanese or another nationality. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

274 | 先 | さき | Tip | Ahead\n First\n Future | Everything that happened to you previously is just the tip of the iceberg, and the important stuff is ahead of you, in your future. So make sure you put that stuff first!\nThe original meaning of this word is the tip of something, like a pen or a finger. From that meaning, it's expanded into all sorts of meanings, like ahead, first, and future, depending on the context and where it is in the sentence. It can also mean "previous" in formal contexts (and we'll accept that meaning too, but we're not teaching it here because it's more advanced). \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nJust ahead of you are the tips of a saw and a key(さき). You have no idea what they're doing there, but both saws and keys have very sharp tips, so watch out you don't hurt yourself. Imagine yourself edging carefully past those saw and key tips.\nYou can differentiate this from 先ず (まず) because it doesn't have any hiragana on the end.
275 | 足りる | たりる | To Be Enough | To Be Sufficient\n To Suffice | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

This word means to be enough. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the た portion. Whenever we need to remember the た we use the word "taco."\nWhat do you have enough of? What is sufficient? Turns out it's tacos (た). Your bunker is filled with them and it's going to be enough to last the winter.
276 | 写す | うつす | To Copy | To Photograph\n To Take A Picture | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

You're copying the documents you need to sue (す) someone who screwed you over. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the うつ part. To remember that, think of yourself as a beatboxer. You're saying うつうつうつ over and over again. Thing is, the other beatboxer is going to copy everything you do. That's why you're suing him.
277 | 出かける | でかける | To Go Out | To Leave | You exit but you do it with かける added to it. Just think of that かける as you are exiting while being "cocky" about it. You do this when you want to go out or to leave. You go out in a cocky way!\nThis word can only be used for a person going out. You can't say a train 出かける'd. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.

It can also mean to type.\nYou can use this word to describe bumping a part of your body on something, hitting a ball or a nail, or typing on a keyboard. It can also describe hitting a person, but that use is less common and sounds a bit literary. \n This word uses the kun'yomi reading, which you haven't learned yet, but never fear! A mnemonic is here:\nIf you’re planning to hit an uni (う), you’re going to need a special bat or hammer. I don’t know why you’d want to hit a sea urchin, but make sure you have the right equipment if you do, because those things are spiky!
279 | 生きる | いきる | To Live | To Be Alive\n To Exist | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means "life," making this word mean "to live." \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use a kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn the い reading with this kanji though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhat does it mean to live? Life is pretty icky (いき ... the き comes from the hiragana part), but you have to take that ickiness and roll with it if you want to have a good life... if you want to live!
280 | 口にする | くちにする | To Mention | To Say\n To Eat\n To Drink | You've already learned that 口 means "mouth" and here it's followed by the particle に, which pinpoints a location. The verb する means "to do" so you're doing something to your mouth! Logically enough, this expression is used to describe lots of actions that you do with your mouth. It's often used to mean to mention or to say, but with an added descriptive nuance that you've said something accidentally or unexpectedly, maybe something you shouldn't have said! 🙊\nIt can also mean other things done with the mouth, like to eat and to drink! \n In this expression, 口 is a standalone vocabulary word, so it uses the same reading that you learned when you learned the vocabulary.
281 | 休む | やすむ | To Rest | To Take Time Off | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

It's to rest or to take time off. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou need to rest, right? Don't just answer with a "yes," this deserves a "YAASS" (やす)! YAAASSS let's RESSST!!!
282 | 申す | もうす | To Say Humbly | To Say | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means say humbly, and this is just the verb form, to say humbly. You can also call this to say, just remember that it's humble!\nThis is a very humble way to say "to say" so it's used in especially formal situations, and only to talk about yourself or your associates. Because of its formality, it's almost always in the ます form, which is 申します. \n The reading for this kanji is the kun'yomi reading, but that's the reading you learned with the kanji. High Fives.
283 | 見る | みる | To See | To Look | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means see so the vocab here means to see or to look. \n The reading for this word is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji (kun'yomi) so you should be able to read this.
284 | 見せる | みせる | To Show |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. It's related to the meaning of the kanji 見 "see," but this one is about having someone else see something. In other words, it means to show. \n The reading for this word is the same as the one that you learned with the kanji, so you should be able to read it.
285 | 気に入る | きにいる | To Take A Liking | To Be Pleased\n To Be Happy | You enter into the energy. When entering into (positive) energy, you are going to take a liking to something and to be pleased and to be happy with it. Just imagine yourself entering into some happy energy when you take a liking to something. \n The 気 portion is pretty straight forward. The 入る reading is the same as the one you learned with the vocabulary 入り口. Just imagine you're really, really, reeeally pleased with your lovely new pet eagle (い)! You're so satisfied and happy with it. Feel the good energy your eagle is bringing you.
286 | 町 | まち | Town |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou walk into this town. You hate it (because it's vocab, and who doesn't hate vocab?). So what do you do? You pull out a match (まち) and burn this town to the ground. Whoa, you some kind of psycho?
287 | 宝 | たから | Treasure |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Your treasure has a tackler (たから) guarding it at all times. He tackles anyone who gets close. If someone wants your treasure, they have to go through the tackler!
288 | 二十日 | はつか | Twentieth Day | Day Twenty\n Twenty Days | Two times ten days is twenty days. \n Words that count days use an exceptional reading. The readings for 二十 are exceptions, and 日 takes the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help with that:\nIf you make one hat for twenty days you'll have enough hats (はつ) to fill up your car (か) completely! That's a lot of days and a lot of hats.
289 | 二百 | にひゃく | Two Hundred |  | When you have two hundreds, you have two hundred. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
290 | 花見 | はなみ | Viewing Cherry Blossoms | Sakura Viewing\n Cherry Blossom Viewing | When you have flowers that you can see, you are viewing flowers. But not just any flowers. What flowers do Japanese people love viewing? That's right, this word refers to viewing cherry blossoms.\nThe focus of 花見 is on the act of appreciating blossoming trees, often accompanied by outdoor gatherings, picnics, or parties. Although cherry blossoms are the most commonly associated flowers, the term can encompass other flower-viewing experiences as well. \n The reading for this vocab is all kun'yomi, but you learned the kun'yomi readings of both these when you learned their kanji. So no worries there. You can spend the extra time viewing the cherry blossoms.
291 | 村 | むら | Village | Rural Town | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. This is the reading you learned already with the kanji. Huzzah!
292 | 村人 | むらびと | Villager |  | You have a village person. That isn't someone dancing while wearing construction worker clothes, that's a villager. \n This word uses double kun'yomi for its reading, probably because it's like two separate words (village and person) put together into one big word. You should know these two kun'yomi readings (it's the main reading for 村 that you learned and you should know 人 by now), though you will need to look out for the rendaku'd びと reading.
293 | 見方 | みかた | Way Of Seeing | Point Of View\n Perspective\n Viewpoint | The way you see is the way of seeing something. This is like when someone has a dumb opinion and you're like "oh, okay, so that's one way of seeing it..." \n This uses the kun'yomi readings from the vocab words 見る and 方. So as long as you're okay with those, you can apply that knowledge over here.
294 | 天気 | てんき | Weather |  | What is the heaven energy? If you think about it, that's all the stuff that falls on us from the sky. Lightning, rain, snow, hail... What is all of that? It's the weather. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
295 | 平日 | へいじつ | Weekdays |  | The flat days are boring. They're the same. One day after another. That's definitely not your exciting weekends... that's your boring, flat weekdays. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 日 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nWeekdays are flat, but you do at least earn two entire bales of hay. Gee, two (へいじつ) of them! What a hard worker you are.
296 | どれ | どれ | Which One | Which | Do re (どれ) mi fa sol la ti... which one of these notes are you going to start singing from?\nThe question word どれ is used to ask which one out of three or more choices.
297 | 白い | しろい | White |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of white? White, of course! \n This has the same reading as the vocab 白 you learned, so you already know the reading. Go you!
298 | 年 | とし | Year | Age | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. You can also use this word to talk about someone's age. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThis year you plan on tossing (とし) out all your old stuff as a New Year's resolution. You pronounce it "toshing" though, because it has more vigor that way.
299 | ２０１１年 | にせんじゅういちねん | Year 2011 | 2011\n The Year 2011 | It's the 2011 year. I think the meaning is pretty obvious. This just means year 2011 or simply 2011. \n The reading is a little trickier. You start with two thousand (二千／にせん), then you need to add eleven to it (十一／じゅういち). Then, you simply add the reading for 年 which you already know. You can assume it's the on'yomi reading because it's attached to something else, like a jukugo. From there, you get the entire reading.
300 | 年中 | ねんじゅう | Year Round | All Year\n Whole Year\n Throughout The Year | The year middle sounds like it should be something like "the middle of the year," but it's not. Think of something that happens in the middle of the year and then all other parts of the year. It's just referring to everything within this year, which is how we get year round. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings for the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. 中 does have a strange reading, though, which is じゅう. This is basically just ちゅう changing to ぢゅう, but since ぢ is very rare it just switches to じ and you end up with じゅう. That's called rendaku.
301 | うん | うん | Yep | Yeah\n Yes | Wanna play Uno (うん)? Yep! 'Course I do. I always wanna play Uno.\nうん is a casual way to say yes, or yeah, so you’d generally use it with friends and family, and in other informal situations.
302 | はい | はい | Yes |  | Want me to write a haiku (はい)? Yes, of course!\nはい is a formal word for "yes". You can use it to let someone know they’re right, or simply that you’re listening, as well as to respond if someone says your name.
303 | 休学 | きゅうがく | Absence From School | School Absence | When you rest from school you are taking an absence from school. This is only for very long absences though, not a day or a week, but months or years. Think about it like taking an extended leave of absence from school. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
304 | 空気 | くうき | Air | Atmosphere\n Mood | The sky energy... once known as a mystical essence that kept us from flying into space. Now we know this is the air. It can also mean atmosphere, though, because that's what a bunch of air between the earth and space is called. ここの空気はいいね！\nFiguratively, this can also refer to the mood that's in the air or room, but not a specific person's mood! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
305 | 考古学 | こうこがく | Archeology | Archaeology | If you often think about studying old things, it's called archeology. All archeology involves thinking about old things, at least a little bit. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
306 | 当たり | あたり | A Success | Success\n Hit\n Guess | This is the noun version of the kanji right. What happens when you get "a right?" You get a success. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the あ portion of this word to read it. What is the correct answer that will give you a success? It is the first answer, A (あ).
307 | 今すぐ | いますぐ | At Once | Right Now\n Immediately\n Right Away | You'll have to learn this word in two parts. You already know the meaning of 今 because of the kanji, which means "now." The すぐ part, however, is a new word, meaning "soon." すぐ and "soon" even start with a similar sound, so maybe that can help you remember this! If you put 今 and すぐ together, you get "now soon." Put in better English, that's at once or right now. \n Since you already know the vocab word 今 (read いま), you should be able to read this word as well.
308 | 牛肉 | ぎゅうにく | Beef |  | What do you call cow meat? You call it beef (what's for dinner?). \n Both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this.
309 | 生まれ | うまれ | Birthplace | Birth | Remember how you learned that 生まれる means "to be born?" Well once you're born that place where it happened becomes your birthplace! \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned 生まれる. Just drop the る off the end and you have your reading!
310 | 青い | あおい | Blue | Unripe | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of blue? It's still blue! It can also mean unripe, which might sound confusing, but it comes down to the fact that in Japanese there's some overlap between blue and green. So while in English we think of the "go" traffic light and unripe bananas as "green," in Japanese they're actually called "blue." \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the あお portion to read this word. Think of blue things on your body. Those are bruises. Touch them. What would you say? OW! (あお).
311 | 体 | からだ | Body |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou have your body. It's nice - looking good! What would really mess up your body? It would be a car raider (からだ). I'm talking about a dude who is a raider of some kind driving a car. If he runs into your body, you're done for, so watch out for the car raider.\nOf course, this mnemonic is only meant to get you close to the reading. Hopefully it is close enough to get you to the actual reading, からだ.
312 | 男の子 | おとこのこ | Boy |  | A man child is a boy.\nThere's a の particle stuck in the middle of this word. Here it just means the noun before の is modifying the noun after.\nBut for now, all you really have to remember is that 男の子 means "boy." \n If you know the kun'yomi readings of both of these kanji you should be okay. You have two separate single-kanji words put together by a の. That's why it's the kun'yomi reading - they're separate.
313 | 〜斤 | きん | Bread Loaf Counter | Counter for Loaves of Bread | This has the 〜 for counters, so you can bet this shares the bread loaf counter meaning with the kanji. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
314 | 兄弟 | きょうだい | Brothers | Siblings | You have an older brother and a younger brother. Wow! Both are here. These are brothers! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
315 | 毛虫 | けむし | Caterpillar |  | When you think of a fur insect what do you think of? My mind immediately goes to a caterpillar. Imagine the furriest caterpillar you can and touch it. How does it feel? Furry? \n The readings for this word are strange. Both use the kun'yomi readings - 虫 uses the reading you learned with the kanji, so that's easy. The 毛 part is like the vocab word 毛 you learned in the previous lesson.
316 | 近い | ちかい | Close | Nearby\n Near | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of near? It's close or nearby. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the ちか portion to be able to read this word. Imagine someone close to you... Too close. They are so close to you that they're touching their cheek (ちか) to your cheek. Feel the cheek on yours, it's getting awkward.
317 | 色 | いろ | Color |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. This is the reading you learned with the kanji, though, so enjoy.
318 | 会社 | かいしゃ | Company | Corporation\n The Office | The place where your company meets is your company. Sony is a company. Nintendo is a company. Etc. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
319 | 作文 | さくぶん | Composition | Writing\n Essay | When you make writing, what are you doing? Simply put, you're writing. If you want to be fancier about it, you could say this is composition.\nNote that 作文 often refers to the end result of a writing process, like a finished essay, rather than the writing process itself. It’s also commonly associated with various writing tasks assigned to students in Japanese elementary or middle school. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since both 文 and 作 have two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which ones to use:\nYou can't stop writing compositions about sacks 'n' buns (さくぶん). You're obsessed with them. You've been writing essay after essay about sacks 'n' buns. Stop writing about sacks 'n' buns!
320 | コンビニ | コンビニ | Convenience Store |  | コンビニ comes from the English word convenience store, but who has time for all those syllables? That's why they cut it down to "conveni". So much more convenient that way.\nWatch out for the “v” sound, which usually becomes “b” in Japanese, and this word is no exception.
321 | 角 | かど | Corner | Angle | When the kanji for angle is used as a standalone word, it usually means corner. You can remember this because corners are pretty much the most common kind of angle you see in everyday life.\nIn math contexts, it can also mean angle — just like the kanji's meaning! \n This word has two different meanings and each one has its own reading.\nWhen it's used for corners, the reading is かど. Just picture a deck of cards (かど). What's the most important part of the card? The corner! The corners are where the numbers are. Now tape those cards into all the corners of your house. Why? Because it's artsy!\nAnd the second meaning and reading pair is easy — angle and かく, which you already know from the kanji!
322 | 代金 | だいきん | Cost | Price | When you buy something, you basically substitute it with money. That substitute money is the cost or price of the thing you're paying for.\nThere are a lot of money-related synonyms in Japanese, but keep in mind this one refers to the money you pay to get some stuff in return (usually goods), not to an expense, price, or value. It's "substitute money" after all! \n This is a jukugo word, which means it uses on'yomi readings for both of the kanji. You already know those, so you should be good to go!
323 | 三日月 | みかづき | Crescent Moon |  | What's a "third day moon"? It's a crescent moon. A crescent moon is the newly visible moon that appears on the third day of the month in the lunar calendar that Japanese people used back in the day. \n The word comes from 三日 and 月, but the readings are slightly different. There's no small つ in the reading for 三日, and you need to rendaku 月, all to make it easier to pronounce. Try reading it aloud yourself to see what I mean!\nTo write the character づ, type "du" on your keyboard.
324 | デパート | デパート | Department Store |  | デパート comes from  department store. Yet another shortened loanword! There's an extra "o" sound on the end of this one, since a word can't end in "t" in Japanese.
325 | 図 | ず | Diagram |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n While words that are made up of a single kanji usually take the kun'yomi reading, this one takes the on'yomi reading. Luckily, this is the same reading you learned with the kanji, so it shouldn't be too hard to remember.
326 | 外交 | がいこう | Diplomacy |  | You want to mix opinions from outside your country into the way you handle things. That's called diplomacy. If you mix your country with the ones outside of your own, you'll all profit! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
327 | 下町 | したまち | Downtown | Backstreets | You have the below town. Does this sort of sound familiar? We have another word for it in English, but it's essentially the same thing: downtown. It isn't the downtown you might be used to though. In Japan, this is an old word that was used for the commercial districts literally, physically down (lower than) the main city. So picture an old, urban Japanese area! \n The reading for this word is all kun'yomi despite being jukugo. Just think of sketchy things going on in the downtown, just like how there's sketchy kun'yomi readings for this word. You should know both the kun'yomi readings from the previous level, though, so if you do you know the reading for this word as well.
328 | 工学 | こうがく | Engineering |  | Someone with the study of industry is someone who creates things. That would be the study of engineering. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
329 | 毎日 | まいにち | Every Day | Daily | Every day is daily (or just every day). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 日 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nEvery day you watch your favorite program, My Nietzsche (まいにち). It's a daily cartoon about Nietzsche and his life, which you follow religiously. Oh how much you love Nietzsche.
330 | 毎月 | まいつき | Every Month | Monthly | Every moon is every month (as you know from all the month-related vocab). This can also mean monthly. \n This word has the on'yomi reading for 毎 plus the kun'yomi reading for 月. That makes it まいつき.
331 | 毎回 | まいかい | Every Time | Each Time | Every times is really just every time. Do you get your kanji readings correct 毎回? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
332 | 毎年 | まいとし | Every Year | Yearly\n Annually\n Each Year | You have every and year to combine into every year (yearly works as well). \n The reading for 毎 is what you'd expect. The reading for 年 is the kun'yomi reading, though. So, use your knowledge of the vocab 年 to help yourself to remember the reading for this word. You'll need to remember that the reading for this word is strange to get it into that brain of yours.
333 | すみません | すみません | Excuse Me | I'm Sorry\n Sorry | Sue me, Ma Sen! (すみません), you yell at Ma Sen, before quickly adding "Excuse me…I'm sorry, so  sorry!" You shouldn't have shouted at Ma Sen like that. You hope she won’t actually sue you.\nYou can use すみません both to apologize and to get someone’s attention. This expression is really common in Japan, and dropping it in wherever you can will help you blend right in!
334 | 羽 | はね | Feathers | Feather\n Wing\n Wings | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji with nothing attached it uses the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji, so you should be able to read this.
335 | 林 | はやし | Forest | Grove | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji it uses the kun'yomi reading. You've already learned this reading with the kanji, though, so you should be able to read this.
336 | 〜形 | けい | Form | Tense | The kanji and the word share one of the same meanings: form. It doesn't just mean form though, it means tense too. Like verb tense. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
337 | 〜年来 | ねんらい | For Some Years | For Years | When you have years coming and going, you know it is for some years. Don't confuse this one with 来年 which means "next year." The kanji 来 comes after the kanji for year, so instead of "coming year" it's "years that come (and go)." At least, you can think of it that way to differentiate.\nYou can also add numbers to this word. For example ５年来 means something to the tune of "for five years." But this is a pretty formal word. Just keep that in mind. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
338 | 古来 | こらい | From Ancient Times | Age-Old | Things that are really old come from ancient times!\nThis is a relatively formal expression that’s used to talk about age-old things, like customs that have stood the test of time. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
339 | 大体 | だいたい | Generally | About\n General\n Gist | If all you can see is the big body of something, then you'll only get a general idea of what it is. You'll be able to say that it's generally a certain way, but that's about all. You'll get the gist, but no more. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nGenerally, it's a bad idea to dye your ties (だいたい). The tie police isn't a big fan of it, and you wouldn't wanna get arrested!
340 | 仕草 | しぐさ | Gesture | Action\n Behavior | Things you end up doing in the grass and not inside probably take a lot of big gestures and actions. You have to do them outside on the grass because if you did them anywhere else you might break something. \n The reading is a combination of on'yomi and kun'yomi. That being said, both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this. Just watch out because rendaku makes くさ become ぐさ.
341 | 金 | きん | Gold |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji you would normally think it uses the kun'yomi reading. Not this word, though. It still uses the on'yomi reading, which you learned with the kanji. Don't confuse this one with お金, though. That one uses kun'yomi which you know because it has a hiragana attached.
342 | 上手い | うまい | Good At | Skillful | Remember how 上手 means that you're good at something? Well, this word uses the exact same kanji, and means the exact same thing! \n That い on the end is your clue that the reading is different, and you can forget about the readings you learned for each kanji. This is a native Japanese word, and the kanji were assigned to it based on the meaning alone. That means you just have to memorize the reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhen you see that someone's good at something, you say, "Ooh, my (うまい)!" at the top of your lungs. Try it! Think of something that impresses you and say "ooh my!" out loud.
343 | 草 | くさ | Grass | Weed | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned the kanji.
344 | 工作 | こうさく | Handicraft | Crafts\n Maneuvering | What is the "industry of make"? Well, it's when you industriously make things, obviously. That can only be handicraft or crafts, often referring to craft activities or hands-on projects done in elementary or middle school!\nBut wait, 工作 isn't just about glue and popsicle sticks! It can also mean maneuvering, in the sense of pulling strings behind the scenes. So, whether you're crafting a masterpiece or scheming a clever plan, 工作 encompasses the wonders of crafting! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 作 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nYour favorite handicraft is making こういち sacks (こうさく). They're sacks that look exactly like こういち, and you're incredibly good at making them. Soon, the Tofugu offices will be decorated all over with your こういち sacks.
345 | 本社 | ほんしゃ | Headquarters | HQ\n Head Office\n Company Headquarters | The origin company is where everything in your company comes from. This is your main base. This is your headquarters. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
346 | 里 | さと | Hometown | Village\n One's Parents' Home | This is the village you came from. This is where your parents live. This is your hometown (same meaning as the kanji you learned).\nThis word is old-fashioned and evokes a warm, nostalgic image of home. Often seen in folktales and traditional songs, it represents an idyllic, pastoral life. \n The reading is the same as with the kanji you learned, so you should feel nice and "at home" with this one 😉
347 | 何日 | なんにち | How Many Days | What Day\n Which Day | What day equals the fairly obvious translation "what day." But, it also means how many days. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji, but 何 actually uses the kun'yomi reading here! And since 日 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember this reading:\nHow many days does it take you to bake a naan Nietzsche (なんにち)? It's not easy to make a Nietzsche entirely out of naan, so I wonder how many days it would take.
348 | 何人 | なんにん | How Many People |  | When you ask what people you're not actually asking "what people?" You're asking how many people. One thing you'll notice with Japanese and kanji is that 何, when added to other things, often means "how many _____" rather than "what ____." Just something you have to know and experience a bit to catch on to, but you will, I believe in you. \n This word uses the kun'yomi reading for 何 and the on'yomi reading for 人. Since 何 and 人 both have two readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which ones to use:\nHow many people eat naan at Nintendo (なんにん)? You've been tasked with counting everybody eating naan for lunch at Nintendo, so you better get started!
349 | 何回 | なんかい | How Many Times |  | What times? This doesn't make any sense. One thing you'll notice with Japanese and kanji is that 何, when added to other things, often means "how many _____" rather than "what ____." Just something you have to know and experience a bit to catch on to, but you will, I believe in you. So, for this one it's how many times. \n This is a jukugo word with a slightly unique reading, where the first kanji uses the kun'yomi reading and the second uses the on'yomi reading. You've seen these readings before, so you should be able to read this alright.
350 | 自立 | じりつ | Independence | Self Reliance | You are able to stand using your self. Nobody is helping you. Nobody is holding you down. This is your independence!\n自立 primarily refers to a person’s ability to stand on their own, make decisions, and act independently. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
351 | 体内 | たいない | Inside The Body | Internal | The body's inside means inside the body or internal.\n体内 refers specifically to internal body stuff, so you'll often see it in medical and scientific contexts. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
352 | 皮肉 | ひにく | Irony | Sarcasm\n Ironic\n Sarcastic | The skin on the meat is kind of like the outer shell. It's not very nice, and people who eat only meat skin tend to use sarcasm and irony. That being said, Japanese people don't really understand sarcasm. So, maybe that's why "meat skin" means "sarcasm." Is this ironic? Now I'm not even sure. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
353 | 入社 | にゅうしゃ | Joining A Company | Entering A Company | When you enter a company you're actually joining a company. Welcome, new recruit. Prepare to be hazed! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
354 | 光 | ひかり | Light | Sunlight | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou have a ton of sunlight where you live. This creates heat. With this sunlight heat you're able to make your favorite food in the world: hickory (ひかり) smoked bacon. Mmm, taste that delicious bacon.
355 | 文学 | ぶんがく | Literature |  | If you study writing, it's called literature. You'll get to study lots of things other people wrote before you! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 文 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nAll the great works of literature are about buns (ぶん). That's the subtle thread running through all literature: buns.
356 | 大声 | おおごえ | Loud Voice | Big Voice | A big voice is a loud voice!\n大声 usually just describes talking in a big voice, but it can also refer to shouting depending on the situation. \n The reading for 声 is ごえ (rendaku'd version of the reading you know: こえ). The reading for 大 is the kun'yomi reading, like with the word 大きい (おおきい). Just imagine a loud voice saying "おお！."
357 | 男の人 | おとこのひと | Man |  | A man person is a man.\nThere's a の particle stuck in the middle of this word. Here it just means the noun before の is modifying the noun after.\nDon't worry if that's hard to remember though. Just remember 男の人 means "man" (and that it's more polite than plain 男). \n This word is actually two separate words combined with a particle. So, since you treat them like separate words, you read each of them with the kun'yomi readings (they are both single kanji words all alone). That being said, in level 4 you learned about the vocab readings for these separate words, so use that knowledge to remember the reading for this word as well.
358 | 多い | おおい | Many | Much\n Lots Of | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of many? It is also many (or you could say much). Speaking of which, there are so many kanji to learn, ammiright? \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThink of something that is many. Doesn't matter what it is as long as you imagine a ridiculous number of them. Many of them. So many that they start avalanching into you and crushing you. The last thing you yell is "おお!!!" as you get smushed.
359 | 多分 | たぶん | Maybe | Perhaps\n Probably | You have many parts. Look at them all. You have to choose one of the parts. You can't decide which one you want. This one? Maybe. How about this one? Hmm, maybe that one too. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
360 | 肉 | にく | Meat |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Luckily for you, this word uses the on'yomi reading that you learned even though it's a single kanji all on its own. So, you should know it already!
361 | お金 | おかね | Money |  | The お is an honorific that makes this word a bit more fancy. When you're talking about money you gotta be fancy, after all. So, you're basically saying "gold" in a nicer way. What was gold back in the day? It was money. \n The reading for 金 is different from the one you learned with the kanji. Makes sense since this is a single kanji with hiragana attached. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou've saved up a ton of money. With it you're going to buy something awesome. Then, suddenly someone hits you in the knees with a bat. Now you have to spend all your money buying a cane (かね). Sucks for you :(
362 | 大作 | たいさく | Major Work | Masterpiece\n Blockbuster | The big make! What is your big make? Bigger than anything else. It is your major work!\n大作 means a large-scale, ambitious, or significant work. Depending on the context, it can refer to anything from an artistically accomplished masterpiece to a big-budget blockbuster movie. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nDid you know that there's a monumental work about a tie sack (たいさく)? It's a masterpiece about a magic sack that produces tie after tie after tie after tie... A bit like The Magic Porridge Pot, but with a sack and ties instead.
363 | 月光 | げっこう | Moonlight | Moonbeam | The moon light (not sunlight!) can be bright sometimes. This is night when you're stumbling home from a nomikai after work. What is this light from the moon called? It's moon light. This word can also mean a moonbeam as well. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 月 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nThe moonlight brings out a strange creature known as a Geck-こういち (げっこう), which are geckos with the head of こういち. Imagine a swarm of them all crawling out of their crevices once the moon comes out.
364 | 来月 | らいげつ | Next Month |  | The next month is the next month! It isn't this month or the month before, it's the next one! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 月 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nNext month is when rye gets (らいげつ) into your diet! You're going to eat only rye bread and drink only rye beer for all of next month. Bet you can't wait!
365 | 来年 | らいねん | Next Year |  | The next year is next year! It isn't last year or this year, it's the next one! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
366 | いいえ | いいえ | No |  | Eeh! Eh? (いいえ) No! You’re so surprised by whatever the question was, you can only manage "Eeh! Eh? No!" in response.\nいいえ is a formal word for "no", so you can use it to answer politely in the negative.
367 | 北西 | ほくせい | Northwest |  | This word is so simple. North + West = Northwest. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
368 | 兄 | あに | Older Brother | Big Brother\n Elder Brother | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This implies that it is your older brother, by the way. Not somebody else's. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYour older brother is different from everyone else's. He has odd powers... some would say powers of the force. Do you know what his name is? It's Ani (あに), short for Anikin... wait a sec, does that sound familiar?
369 | 自分 | じぶん | Oneself | Myself\n Self | One’s self part is, after everything, still oneself. And the part that’s from my self is, well, myself. Everyone has their own part of their self. Pretty straightforward. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
370 | 三十代 | さんじゅうだい | One's Thirties |  | You have the number "thirty", and age. So this refers to one's thirties. \n This uses on'yomi for all the kanji, so you should be good to go here!
371 | 一回 | いっかい | One Time | Once | One times is one time. How many times? Just one. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Take note that 一 is shortened (as it often is) to いっ.
372 | 空車 | くうしゃ | Open Taxi | Empty Parking Space | When a car has sky in it (and not, say, a bunch of people) it is free to give you a ride. If you see this sign lit up on a taxi feel free to hail it down, it will be able to take you somewhere. It is an open taxi. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
373 | 本来 | ほんらい | Originally | Primarily\n Essentially\n Naturally | You want to talk about the origin where something comes from. That's where it is from originally. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
374 | 体力 | たいりょく | Physical Strength | Physical Power\n Stamina\n Endurance | You have your body power. This is just another way to say physical strength. Watch out, if you use too much of your physical strength you may run out of physical stamina and endurance completely! They're tied together, so make sure to pace yourself. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 力 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nYour physical strength and stamina are tied together with a tie lock (たいりょく). That's a lock made of ties that ties your strength and stamina up together, making it much easier to pace yourself.
375 | 豚 | ぶた | Pig |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji.
376 | 雨 | あめ | Rain |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji it uses the kun'yomi reading. Lucky for you, you learned this reading with the kanji.
377 | 本当 | ほんとう | Reality | Truth\n Real\n True | What is real is right. It is the reality. It is also the truth. Don't believe anything that isn't real and true. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
378 | 近年 | きんねん | Recent Years |  | The close years are years that aren't too long ago. They are the recent years.\nThis is a formal word that is often used in writing or formal speech. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
379 | 米 | こめ | Rice |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nNote that this word refers to the grains of rice more than something that's a meal. If you're eating rice at a meal you'd call it ごはん. This is like when you're talking about the rice in the fields or rice grains or something like that. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\n"Everyone, we have rice! Come (こめ) and get it!"
380 | 同じ | おなじ | Same |  | This word is the kanji same with hiragana attached, and it also means same.\nIt's a bit of an oddball among Japanese adjectives, because you don't need な or い to attach it to a noun. So it's usually considered to be a "special" な-adjective. Have a look at the context sentences to see it in action! \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhen you think of the word "same" think same owner (おな). You're looking at a restaurant that has a sign that says, "New owners!" However, when you walk in you see it's the same terrible owner you remember from before. What a liar.
381 | 同日 | どうじつ | Same Day | The Same Day | You have the same day, which comes out to same day.\nNote that this word is quite formal. To say the same day more casually, just use 同じ日! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 日 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nOn the same day, you once ate two entire doughnuts. Gee, two (どうじつ) on the same day? How did that feel?
382 | 入学 | にゅうがく | School Admission | University Admission\n Entry Into School\n Enrollment | You enter into a study (place). When does this happen? It happens when you get accepted into a school, aka school admission, university admission, or entry into school. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
383 | 学年 | がくねん | School Grade | Grade In School\n School Year\n Year In School | Your study year is kind of like the years you've studied. Where do you study? School. What is a year of study in a school? It's your school grade. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
384 | 皮 | かわ | Skin | Hide | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nAs a human (we think), you have a lot of skin. But sometimes a normal shower isn't enough to wash all that skin. What do you do when you can't fit all your skin in the shower or the tub? You get your skin cleaned at the car wash, of course!
385 | 空 | そら | Sky |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nIn the sky, you are the ruler. You are known as "The soarer!" (そら). Imagine your theme song and make sure it includes "soarer of the sky" or something awesome like that.
386 | 水色 | みずいろ | Sky Blue | Light Blue\n Aqua Blue | You'd think that water color would have something to do with watercolors, but it doesn't. No, it has to do with the color of water, which, ironically, is sky blue in English. Light blue works as well. \n The reading for this word consists of the kun'yomi reading of 水 and the kun'yomi reading of 色. For 水 you'll know this reading via your vocab studies. For 色 it just so happens to be the reading you learned with the kanji.
387 | 近日 | きんじつ | Soon | In A Few Days\n Coming Days | The near day is a day coming very soon. It's a day coming in a few days or in the coming days. In other words, you wouldn't use this word for something that's going to happen in a few minutes, or a few months.\nThis is a relatively formal word that is commonly used in professional or official contexts. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 日 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nSoon, the place where you live will have two kings. Gee, two (きんじつ) of them? Yep, yours is the first country ever to have two kings.
388 | 音 | おと | Sound | Noise | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nDid you hear that sound? It's barely audible (おと). Go ahead and say the word "audible" with the pronunciation of おと to help you to remember this.
389 | 四角 | しかく | Square | Rectangle\n Cube | What shape has four angles? The most common one is a square, but it could also be a rectangle or even a cube. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings for the kanji. You've learned them both already, so you should be able to read this word!
390 | 学生 | がくせい | Student |  | Who has a study life? Only one person that I know of, and that's a student. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
391 | 日光 | にっこう | Sunlight |  | You have sun light. What kind of light would this be? Obviously sunlight. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since the にち reading of 日 becomes にっ here, we've made a mnemonic for you to remember this reading:\nThe best place for sunlight in Japan is Nikkō (にっこう). It's one of Japan's most beautiful national parks, and the perfect spot to catch some rays!
392 | 金玉 | きんたま | Testicles |  | You have some gold balls. What balls are more important than any other balls, at least for a dude? That would be his testicles.\nThis word came about because tanuki scrotum skin would be used to pound down gold into sheets. Tanuki scrotums are apparently very good at this because they are very strong and very flexible. Strange, yeah? That's why Gold balls = testicles.\nAs you might have guessed, this word is slang and you'll probably want to avoid using it at the doctor's! It's a comical word that is used in casual situations. \n This word uses the on'yomi for 金 and the kun'yomi for 玉. If you know the readings of your kanji, you'll know how to read this as well.
393 | それ | それ | That One | Those Ones | Sorry (それ), can you grab that one for me? Yeah, that, thanks!\nYou can use それ for things that are close to the person you're talking to, or fairly close to both of you.
394 | その他 | そのほか | The Others | Other\n Other Than That | その means "that" or "the", and その plus other means things like the others, other, and other than that, depending on the context. \n This has two readings, but luckily you learned one of them when you learned the kanji, and the other one when you learned the word 他. The two readings are usually interchangeable, too.
395 | 今回 | こんかい | This Time |  | The now times is this time. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
396 | 何千 | なんぜん | Thousands | Several Thousands\n How Many Thousands | What thousand? Could be five thousand, two thousand, or ten thousand, since you're asking. Let's generalize. How do you say all of those amounts at the same time? You say "thousands."\nIf this is used in a question, it can also mean how many thousands? \n The reading is the kun'yomi なん for 何 and the rendaku'd on'yomi reading for 千 (ぜん) combined together. It's one of those weird words that mixes the on'yomi and kun'yomi readings.
397 | 〜回 | かい | Times | Number Of Times\n Time | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the on'yomi reading which you learned with the kanji. This is probably because this word gets attached to numbers usually, which makes it behave more like jukugo. So, you can have １回, ２回, ３回, or even １００回 if you're into that sort of thing.
398 | 当たる | あたる | To Be Right | To Be On Target\n To Touch\n To Hit | You know this is a verb because it ends with an う sound. The kanji for this word is right or success, so what's the verb form of that? Turns out it's a ton of things. Like, a crazy amount of things. I tried narrowing it down for you, but it will still be a lot. This word tends to be about getting an answer right. As in, to be right or to be on target. It means many other things too, but I think these are the two meanings you'll see the most, so focus on those. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the あ portion.\nWhen your guess turns out to be right, you can't help but shout, "Ah! (あ)" That "Ah" is your victory cry.
399 | 見える | みえる | To Be Visible | To Be In Sight\n Can See\n To Seem | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means see, and 見える is to be visible, or to be in sight, though it's often more naturally translated into English as can see. It's used when you don't actively intend to see something, it just happens.\nThis verb can also mean to seem, when talking about how you perceive something you can see. \n The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned with the kanji (the kun'yomi reading). So as long as you know that you should be able to read this word as well.
400 | 来る | くる | To Come |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means come so you know this word means to come. \n The reading for this word is pretty strange. It changes depending on the type of verb form you use (it's a pesky exception verb). To remember the reading of this word, here's a mnemonic:\n"I want you to come to the cool (く) side, Luke," says Darth Vader.\n"What?" replies Luke.\nJust replace this line into the famous line from Star Wars. Say it out loud. Do the Vader voice. It'll help you to remember.
401 | 下がる | さがる | To Get Lower | To Go Down\n To Come Down\n To Hang Down | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means below so this means something gets lower, by falling or dropping. For example: Prices get lower or fall. Squirrels come down from trees. See? No direct object here. That's why this verb means to get lower or to go down. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. Let's use a mnemonic to remember the reading of the kanji:\nYou know it means to fall so instead of using a saw (さ) to cut down the tree, you decide to let it come to you. It has to come down all by itself. Picture yourself placing a saw at the foot of a tree then sitting back and waiting for it to drop itself at your knees. (This could actually work, don't you judge my methods!)
402 | 生む | うむ | To Give Birth | To Produce | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means "life" so what is the verb form of that? Would it be "to do life"? No, probably not. In this case it is to give birth, or to produce.\nYou'll have to differentiate this one from the word 生まれる as well. You can remember that this one means "to give birth" because when you compare, the act of giving birth probably feels shorter than the act of being birthed, at least in terms of sheer terror. The pain of giving birth will make it feel quick, when you look back on it... but just imagine how traumatized the baby must be from going through that as well. So, the act of giving birth is shorter, just like the word itself! \n You have to remember the う part of this word to be able to read it. It's the same as 生まれる, so that could help if you've learned that word already. If not, just imagine yourself giving birth, but not to a baby. Instead, it’s an uni (う) you’re delivering. And of course, all you can do when bringing the spiky uni into the world is scream: "UUuUUuuUUuUuu!”
403 | 行く | いく | To Go |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means go so the verb form of this is to go. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the い portion. To remember い we use the word "eagle."\nYou want to go somewhere (anywhere!) but you can't. An eagle (い) blocks your path. You try to go forward and it opens its wings and bites at you. You try to go back and it jumps at you. There's nowhere for you to go with this eagle standing there.
404 | 上がる | あがる | To Go Up | To Rise\n To Get Higher | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means above so this means something rises. For example: A fever goes up. The sun rises. See? No direct object here. That's why this verb means to go up or to rise.\nBe careful not to confuse this with its transitive buddy 上げる, which means "to lift something" or "to raise something." With that other verb, someone is doing the lifting, it's not happening by itself like it is here. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you can guess that it uses the kun'yomi reading, which also happens to be a reading you didn't learn when you learned the kanji. Let's use a mnemonic for the kun'yomi reading now, though. You have to remember at least the あ part to read it.\nYou know that this word means to go up. Imagine something just rising on its own, like a floating tree or something. What would you say? Probably a "surprised" sound. Maybe you'd scream "あ!" when you saw this floating tree.\nIf you need help remembering the hiragana part, imagine that it's a girl rising up and you scream "Ah! Girl!"(あがる).
405 | 入れる | いれる | To Insert | To Put In | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji 入 means "enter," but this word does not mean "to enter" (which you already learned as 入る). Still, the meaning of 入れる is still related to the kanji's meaning: it means to insert or to put in. It's something you do to another object, like inserting a key into a lock, or your hand into a glove. \n When a vocab is a single kanji plus some okurigana (hiragana stuck on the end of kanji) it's almost always going to be the kun'yomi reading. This is one of two kun'yomi readings you'll be learning for the kanji 入. As long as you know that this vocab means to insert, you can use that to remember the reading as well.\nImagine inserting your hand into a hole and an eagle (い) flies out, screaming: "い!" This is something that happens every time you insert your hand into something: an eagle comes out. You don't know why.
406 | 学ぶ | まなぶ | To Learn | To Study In Depth\n To Study | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means study or learning. When you do these things, what ends up happening? You learn. That's why this word means to learn.\nThere is another word that means "to learn" that is going to be more common, which is 習う. You'll learn this one later on. 学ぶ sounds a little more serious compared to 習う, so keep that in mind when you use it. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the まな part to learn this word's reading. Think about a class you're taking. It's a manners class, and you're there to learn manners (まな). Imagine this study of manners and imagine yourself practicing it.
407 | 作る | つくる | To Make | To Build\n To Create | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means make. The verb form of that is to make. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the つく portion. In order to do that let's think about something that you're going to make. Imagine something really awesome. You complete it and look at your masterpiece. It's amazing. You realize right then and there that it's too cool (つく) for the general public to see. You proceed to smash it. It's way too cool.
408 | 会う | あう | To Meet | To Encounter | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means meet so the verb form of that is to meet or to encounter. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the あ part but let's include the う as well for this one. Who do you want to meet more than anyone? Think about it. Then, imagine meeting them. The first thing they do is grab your arm and pinch it. You yell out "OW!" (あう) and they laugh and run away.
409 | 交ぜる | まぜる | To Mix Something |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means mix so the verb version is to mix something.\nIt’s transitive, so you’re doing the mixing. With this word, the things you’ve mixed are still distinguishable from each other. Two types of fish in your aquarium, books of different genres on your shelf — that kind of thing. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWho always said not to mix your white and red socks in the laundry? That would be your Ma (ま).
410 | 回る | まわる | To Revolve | To Go Around\n To Rotate | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means times. There's no good verb for the word "times" but you can probably imagine something doing something over and over and over again. What word would represent this? It would be to revolve, to go around, or to rotate.\nBear in mind that this verb is intransitive, so it happens on its own. Something revolves or rotates, all by itself. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have a bag of walnuts that you're bringing to a friend's house but you trip and drop them all on the ground. You shout, "Mah Walnuts! (まわ)" as they start to revolve around you on the ground. Picture your walnuts going around you, getting all dirty.
411 | 走る | はしる | To Run |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means run so now you know the verb version of that is to run. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the はし portion. Think of yourself running. It's nice. As you run, though, you notice the ground changing into something weird and mushy. Everything is turning into hash (はし) browns. You start to get sucked in, and soon you can't run anymore. Smell the hash browns and taste them too. What a terrible run this was.
412 | 言う | いう | To Say |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means say, so the verb version of that is to say. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nTo remember the reading い we use the word "eagle."\nYou're trying to say something, but every time you try to say anything an eagle (い) swoops down and pecks at your face then flies away. Just imagine yourself saying tiny bits of words, then an eagle crashing down on your face. Then, you wait in silence. Nothing happens. You try to say something again, and the eagle swoops down on you again.
413 | 立てる | たてる | To Stand Something Up | To Make Something\n To Set Something Up | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means "stand" and this means to stand something up. It also can mean to make something, both in a physical sense, like making a sound, and a mental sense, like making a plan.\nDon't confuse this with 立つ. 立てる means that you're standing something up. As in, "I stood up the action figure" or "I will erect the flag." You're doing the action to something else. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned the kun'yomi reading for this kanji with 立つ, so you should be good to go!
414 | 止まる | とまる | To Stop |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. Something comes to a stop. No direct object here. That's why this verb means to stop. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned the 止める, so you should be able to read it already!
415 | 出す | だす | To Take Out | To Hand Out\n To Remove\n To Turn In\n To Put Out | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means "exit" and this is kind of a verb form of this. The word means to take out or to hand out, so it's like you're doing the action of causing something else to exit (rather than exiting yourself).\nIn other words, this verb is transitive, like most verbs ending in す. You can remember this because the hiragana す is like the word "sue." You're taking out way too much of something, and someone's going to sue (す) you for it. \n The part of the word that you have to learn how to read is the だ portion. Remember how someone was going to sue you for trying to take out way too much? Well, that someone is your Dad (だ)! Your own Dad is going to sue you if you keep taking out way too much stuff, so you better stop!
416 | 考える | かんがえる | To Think About | To Consider\n To Give Thought | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means think, so the verb version is to think about or to consider.\nNote that this isn't the "to think" that is like "I think that he is a power ranger." No, this is more like the actual thinking action. That's why this word is "to think about" or "to consider" rather than plain old "to think" which is 思う. \n If you want to think, the best way to do so is to do the conga (かんが). Imagine yourself doing the conga and thinking away. You're so inspired! The thoughts are flowing as freely as your sweet, slow dance moves.
417 | 分かる | わかる | To Understand | To Be Understandable | This word means to understand, which might surprise you if you remember that the kanji 分 means part. Think of it this way: to understand something you have to break it down into its parts to see how it works.\nWatch out, though, because whereas in English you understand something, in Japanese the thing you understand is the grammatical subject (it's doing the action). So, a more literal meaning for this is to be understandable. In other words, there's no object, and 分かる is intransitive, meaning it happens on its own. The かる ending is a hint, because verbs with かる as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou scream "WAHHHHHH" (わ) in terror and "CAAAR!!!" (か) as you careen down the freeway. Your dad is driving like a maniac and almost hit another car! "WAAH CAAAR!!!" (わか) you scream again. If only he understood your terror!
418 | 行き | ゆき | Train Direction | Bound For | This is a weird word. Call it exceptional. You'll see this at train stations, especially. You know the kanji means go. So, something is going somewhere. Now just use the き to help you to remember that this word means train direction (aka it tells you which direction a train is going), because this word is the key (き) to you knowing what direction you're going in so you don't get lost. You could also remember this word as "bound for" aka "Bound for Tokyo Station." \n The reading is also an exception. It can be いき, but instead we're focusing on the ゆき reading. You have to remember the ゆ portion, so think of it this way:\nJust think about the train direction that you (ゆ) need to go in. It's all about you. Not your friends or anyone else. You. You are the most important person at this train station.
419 | 走行 | そうこう | Traveling | Running\n Moving\n Driving | A vehicle that run-goes is running and it's moving you somewhere else. You're traveling!\nThis word is typically used to describe the movement of vehicles such as cars and trains. It carries a slightly formal or rigid tone, so keep an eye on our context sentences to make sure you’re using it right! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
420 | 三角 | さんかく | Triangle |  | When you have something with three angles, what shape is that? It's a triangle. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
421 | 大学 | だいがく | University | College\n Uni | What's the big study? If I had to choose, I'd probably say this is college or university. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nYour university is best known for its dye gawking (だいがく). It's a sport in which you gawk at dye, and your university is the best at it! Other universities might be known for their football or basketball teams, but yours is the best at dye gawking.
422 | 今まで | いままで | Until Now | Up To Now\n So Far | You know that 今 means now. What you probably don't know is that まで means "until." So, this word means until now. \n The reading for this word is the kun'yomi reading which you learned previously when you learned the vocab word 今. You can tell this is a kun'yomi reading because it has hiragana attached. So if you know that, you should be able to read this word as well.
423 | 谷 | たに | Valley |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. This happens to be the reading you learned with the kanji, too, so don't feel like you're stuck in a valley of despair or anything. Rejoice!
424 | 色々 | いろいろ | Various |  | This is the kanji color repeated twice (the 々 character just repeats the kanji before it). When you have colors and colors and colors, you have a lot of variety. That's why this word means various. \n The reading for this kanji is just the kun'yomi reading twice. Since you've learned the kun'yomi reading already, you should be able to read this word as well. Nothing tricky about it.
425 | 声 | こえ | Voice |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned with the kanji making it easy to remember!
426 | 西 | にし | West |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou go off to the west. It's the Wild West, even. There aren't many people out here, making it easy to find a niche (にし) for your snake oil business.
427 | 何 | なに | What |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this word is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji. What? Yeah, that's what.
428 | 何月 | なんがつ | What Month | Which Month | You have what month - as in: what month is it? It's １０月, you fool. Get a job, hippy. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji, but 何 actually uses the kun'yomi reading here! And since 月 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember this reading:\nWhat month gives you naan guts (なんがつ)? It's the month you eat so much naan that even your guts turn into naan! But which month was it again?
429 | 何年 | なんねん | What Year | How Many Years | You have the kanji what and year, as in: "what year is it?"\nThis also means how many years too, depending on the context. As in: "How many years did you play soccer?" \n The readings are both the readings you learned with the separate kanji, meaning you should know them. How many years have you been studying kanji now? You should be able to read this one.
430 | 麦 | むぎ | Wheat | Barley\n Oats | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji that uses the kun'yomi reading which is the reading you learned with the kanji.
431 | 一生 | いっしょう | Whole Life | All Through Life\n Lifelong | One life is all you get. It's your whole life. This can also mean all through life, and when it's used as an adjective it means lifelong. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for 生 though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWho has been in charge of you your whole life? The shogun (しょう). He owns everyone and that's how it will stay for your entire life.
432 | 社内 | しゃない | Within The Company | In House\n Inside The Company | When you're doing something inside the company you're doing it within the company or in-house. For example, we do our kanji in-house. It gives it that artisan flavor. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
433 | 毛糸 | けいと | Wool Yarn | Yarn | When you have fur string (aka string made of fur) what do you think of? Hopefully wool yarn. \n The readings for these kanji are the kun'yomi readings. With 毛 you should have learned this reading via the vocab word in the previous level. With 糸 it's actually the main reading for the kanji, so you should already know it.
434 | あなた | あなた | You | Darling | "A gnat, ah! (あなた). I’m going to get you! Yes YOU," you shout as you swat at that pesky gnat buzzing around your head.\nあなた is a lot less common than “you” in English, but you’ll come across it in adverts, online forums, and textbooks, where it’s used to address a general, anonymous audience. Some people also use it with their significant other, in which case it sounds intimate, like "darling". In casual conversations, though, it can come off as standoffish, so it's better to use someone's name or social title (like "teacher") instead.
435 | 弟 | おとうと | Younger Brother | Little Brother | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou look at your younger brother. He's a scheming one. He's smiling up at you. Why? Because he's lit a firecracker on your foot. It explodes, sending your toe flying. You yell "OH. Toe? TOE!" (おとうと) as you realize what's going on.
436 | 青年 | せいねん | Youth | Young Man\n Young Adult | Someone who is in their young years is a youth, or young man.\n青年 refers to young adults, usually in their late teens to early twenties. The word is gender-neutral in legal or official contexts, but in everyday use 青年 usually refers to young men. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. That said, this reading can be easy to confuse with other similar words, so here's a mnemonic to help you out:\nThe youth like to play with sabers (せい) and nendoroids (ねん). Think about it: as you leave childhood and become a 青年, you want more mature and dangerous hobbies, right? So you move on from plastic swords and soft toys to playing with real sabers and nendoroid action figures. You're such a cool 青年.
437 | 後で | あとで | After | Afterwards\n Later | This shares one of the meanings you learned for the kanji: after. You can differentiate this one from 後ろ (which you may or may not have seen yet) thanks to the で on the end. Some people believe that after something's dead (で), it goes to an afterlife. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nAfter. Everything happens after. It's a cause and effect chain. One thing happens, and then another thing happens after. This is life. This is the universe. Everything is after. It's an automatic (あと) cycle that just keeps going and going and going.
438 | 全て | すべて | All | Entire\n Everything | This has a little hiragana attached to it but nothing that suggests it's a verb or an adjective. That means you can assume this word has the same meaning as its parent kanji. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou wanted to remember everything about your trip, so you bought every souvenir (すべ) available in the entire shop to ensure you had all the mementos possible.
439 | 全日本 | ぜんにほん | All Japan | All Of Japan | You know 日本 means "Japan." So, now you have the kanji for all added to it, making this word All Japan (as in "All Japan Railways" or something like that). \n You know the reading of 日本. Now just add the on'yomi reading of 全 and you should be able to read this word.
440 | 午前 | ごぜん | AM | Morning\n A.M. | You have something that's before (or in front of) noon. What is before noon? That is AM. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
441 | 足首 | あしくび | Ankle |  | What is the neck of your leg? Think about it. It's your ankle. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings from both kanji, probably because it includes body parts. You know the kun'yomi reading of 足 from previous vocab and you know the kun'yomi reading of 首 from learning that kanji. So, you should be able to read this kanji so long as you remember that it's all kun'yomi.
442 | カバン | カバン | Bag | Handbag\n Backpack | If there’s a car ban (カバン), you’ll need a nice bag to carry all your stuff in. You can’t just throw it all in the car, so get yourself a nice bag instead.\nカバン is used for bags that you can close and that have a fairly rigid structure, like handbags and backpacks, but not more flimsy bags that don't close, like plastic bags and paper bags.\nThis word can also be written in hiragana and kanji. All versions are pretty common, but you'll probably see it in katakana the most.
443 | 後ろ | うしろ | Behind | Back\n Rear | The hiragana attached to this word doesn't suggest it's a verb or an adjective, so we can assume it's a noun. While 後で (you may or may not have seen this word yet) means "after," this one means all the other meanings you learned with the kanji: behind, back, and rear. Think of the ろ as a hint. It's like saying you're on the "road" (ろ) and you're driving so fast you're leaving everything "behind." \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nContinue to think you're driving on this road. You hit something, then look behind you, seeing you hit a cow. Know the word for cow in Japanese? It's うし, which is also the reading for this word.
444 | 出血 | しゅっけつ | Bleeding | Bleed | When the thing that is exiting is blood, you are probably bleeding. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.\nNote that the しゅつ from 出 gets shortened to しゅっ. That's a small つ there, not a big one.
445 | 血 | ち | Blood |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou cut yourself and there's blood everywhere. You need to stop the bleeding with something, but the only thing nearby is a block of cheese. You grab the cheese and stuff it into your gash, but the blood comes out the holes (it is Swiss cheese, blargh!). Imagine this in great detail to be able to remember it well.
446 | 両方 | りょうほう | Both | Both Sides\n Both Ways | Here you have both directions / ways. Every time you have to choose between something it's like having to choose between two ways. That's why this word is simply both.\nClose to the kanji is the meaning both sides, as well. Learn either for 両方, they're pretty similar. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
447 | 両日 | りょうじつ | Both Days |  | Kanji doesn't go together much better than this. Both plus day equals both days.\nThis is a bit of a formal word though, you'll hear important people say it more than your friends. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 日 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nOn both days of your vacation, you get two boats to row! Gee, two (りょうじつ) boats at once? Try not to fall in!
448 | 両手 | りょうて | Both Hands | Both Arms | Don't use one hand when you can use both hands. This is simply both plus hand put together. It can also mean both arms. \n This word uses the readings you learned with both kanji. No problemo for a kanji master such as yourself.
449 | 明るい | あかるい | Bright | Cheerful | This is a single kanji plus the hiragana るい. Words that end in い are usually adjectives, and this is no exception. What's the adjective form of bright? It's also bright. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the あか portion. What is あか in Japanese? It is "red." So, think of something that's really bright. Now, imagine it being totally red (aka あか). In Japan, the color red is associated with the sun, and the sun is pretty bright. If you can remember this you can also remember the reading of this word.
450 | 茶色 | ちゃいろ | Brown | Brown Color\n Color Brown | What is the color of tea? You'd think it would be green, assuming it's Japanese... but this word came from China. What color is Chinese tea? It tends to be more brown. Think Oolong tea, for example. \n The readings for both kanji are the readings you learned with the kanji, meaning you should be able to read this already.
451 | 仕方がない | しかたがない | Can't Be Helped | It's No Use\n There's No Other Way | You’ve already learned 仕方, which you know means "method" or "way of doing." When you don’t (that’s the がない part) have a way of doing or achieving something, you could say it can’t be helped, it’s no use, or there’s no other way. Makes sense, right? This is a popular phrase in Japanese, so we're sure you'll encounter it a lot! \n You already know how to read this from having learned 仕方, so you should be good to go!
452 | 安い | やすい | Cheap | Inexpensive | This is a single kanji with an い at the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. One of the meanings of 安 is cheap, so this is just that as an adjective, cheap. Time to go to a 100円 shop and get some 安い goods, ammiright? \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n"Would you like this item for cheap?"\n"YAASS (やす), please!"
453 | 中国 | ちゅうごく | China |  | The middle country... who could that be? Let's think about it. Who invented kanji and therefore probably thinks they're the middle of the world? Who also is just a huge country that ruled much of Asia? That would be none other than China. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just make sure you watch out for the rendaku.
454 | 社長 | しゃちょう | Company President | President Of A Company | The company leader is the company president. Be sure to greet your 社長 with a hearty good morning when they stumble in! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
455 | 活用 | かつよう | Conjugation | Practical Use | What do you use to show that a word is lively? Conjugation! Lively things are happening, so you have to conjugate your words to match.\nIt also has another meaning. When you want to actually use something lively you are making practical use of it. I mean, you're using it, after all. So as long as you aren't pretending to use it, it's probably practical. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
456 | 国 | くに | Country | Nation | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nTell me about your country. Now imagine that everyone in your country has cool knees (くに). That's because the national dress code is shorts, so everyone's knees get chilly. That why they have cool knees. You could also imagine cool knees in the sense of trendy knees. What makes for cool knees, in your opinion?
457 | 文化 | ぶんか | Culture |  | Writing has changed our entire culture. In fact, when someone reads a good piece of writing it changes them, and changes their culture too. What writing has changed you so much it has changed your culture and the way you act? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 文 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nIn your culture, everyone drives bun cars (ぶんか). Indeed, bun cars are the height of culture. And because they're made out of buns, they're much less dangerous.

460 | 方言 | ほうげん | Dialect |  | The way you say things is your dialect. It's an entire "way" of speaking.\nYou can even think of the  方 as being a "direction." If you go far enough in different directions in a country, you'll discover different regional dialects. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
461 | 方向 | ほうこう | Direction |  | The direction yonder over there is still just the direction of something, though a complicated way to say it, I think. This direction is the "what direction did he go in?" sort of direction. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
462 | ドル | ドル | Dollar |  | ドル is the Japanese version of the English word dollar.\nThe dollar symbol $ is also common in Japanese, and the pronunciation is still ドル.
463 | 早く | はやく | Early | Soon\n Quickly\n Fast | This is the adverb version of the kanji early. It's a little thing you can begin sentences with to say you're doing something early or quickly. \n Since you already know the reading of the vocab word 早い, you should be able to read this word as well.
464 | 東 | ひがし | East |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou see a man walking east, toward the sun rising behind that tree, but it's too bright. He trips and he gashes (ひがし) his foot on a root that was sticking out of the ground. His foot is torn up really bad, but he tries to take another step and, oh no, he gashes his foot again! This guy is not having an easy time going east.
465 | 東方 | とうほう | Eastward | Eastern Direction\n The East | The East direction is Eastward or the East.\nThis word has an old-fashioned feel to it. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
466 | 活気 | かっき | Energy | Liveliness\n Vigor\n Spirit | If you have lively energy you have more than enough energy for everyone to start noticing. They come up to you and compliment you on your amazing liveliness. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Just be careful because かつ is being shortened here to かっ. It's a pretty common change for on'yomi ending in つ, so keep your eyes open for more that do this!
467 | 十分 | じゅうぶん | Enough | Sufficient\n Plenty | You have ten parts out of ten. Which means you have quite enough. The amount you have is sufficient and plenty. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
468 | 元パートナー | もとぱーとなー | Ex-Partner | Former Partner | Your origin partner is a partner you had originally, but don't have anymore. In other words, this is your ex-partner or former partner.\nLike in English, this word is fairly formal, and it covers any kind of ex-partner, including business and romantic partners. \n This uses the kun'yomi of 元 and then it's just kana, so you should know how to read this!
469 | 有名 | ゆうめい | Famous |  | When you have a name (that is known to people) or you have famousness, you are probably someone who is famous. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
470 | 名曲 | めいきょく | Famous Music | Famous Song\n Famous Tune\n Masterpiece | Famous music is famous music. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
471 | 早口 | はやくち | Fast Talker | Fast Talking\n Fast Speaker\n Fast Speaking | When you have a fast mouth, you're probably a fast talker, right motormouth? \n Remember how body parts often change even jukugo words to kun'yomi readings? That's what happened here too. Both readings are kun'yomi, making this one はやくち.
472 | 外国 | がいこく | Foreign Country | Other Countries\n Overseas | An outside country is one outside of your own country. That is a foreign country, other countries, or overseas. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
473 | 外国人 | がいこくじん | Foreign Person | Foreigner | You know 外人 the word that means "foreigner," but that word is a bit informal and can come off as rude. The nicer, more politically correct version of the word is the one above. An outside country person. To differentiate this from "foreigner" we're going to use the more polite English version of this word as well (just like in Japanese): Foreign Person. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nRemember how to spot a foreigner? That's right, they'll be in jeans (じん)!
474 | 四十二 | よんじゅうに | Forty Two | The Answer | Four tens plus two. That equals forty two.\nP.S. Please don't panic. "The Answer" is NOT a correct answer for this. It is just a reference to the greatest book of all time. Sorry for the confusion and so long and thanks for all the fish. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. But! Don't forget, 四 uses the kun'yomi reading, since the on'yomi reading sounds too much like the word for "death."
475 | 前 | まえ | Front | Before | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nWhat's in front of you? Think about it. Make it something ridiculous. Now look at a tag that's on it. Who does this thing belong to? Oh, wait, it's my (まえ) thing there in front of me. Say that out loud for better memory.
476 | 全力 | ぜんりょく | Full Effort | Every Effort\n Best Effort\n Full Power | When you put all your power into something, you're putting your full effort into it. Hopefully that's what you put into your kanji learning as well! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 力 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nWith your full effort, you were able to produce a Zen lock (ぜんりょく). It's a lock imbued with the power of Zen, meaning no one and nothing could possibly break it. It's the one lock to rule them all.
477 | 出社 | しゅっしゃ | Going To The Office | Arriving At The Office\n Coming To Work | If you exit somewhere in order to go to your company, that's going to the office, arriving at the office, and coming to work. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Just watch out for  the しゅつ, which gets changed to しゅっ, as many つs do in this situation.
478 | 正直 | しょうじき | Honest | Honestly | You have correct and fix. When you're always fixing things to make them correct (for example, someone's lies!) you are a very honest person. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. This is the case here too, but both kanji use their slightly less common secondary readings. You do know both of those, but in case you need a little help, here's a mnemonic anyway:\nBe completely honest, what's the strangest sound you've ever heard? The Shougun (しょう) going "jikijiki (じき)"?! Honestly, that does sound quite strange...
479 | 本州 | ほんしゅう | Honshuu | Honshu | You have your origin state. For Japan (since this is a Japanese word), that would be the main island, the big one in the middle: Honshu. You'll have to know some minor Japanese geography for this. Go look at a map of Japan and study it over real quick to see where I'm talking about if you don't know already. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
480 | 家 | いえ | House | Home | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji. But there's a second reading you haven't learned yet, so here's a mnemonic for both:\nWhat do you do in your house? You eat eggs (いえ). You love to eat eggs at home. But it has to be on the 内 (うち), a.k.a. the inside, of your house. For some reason you can only eat eggs in the 内 of your house.\nBoth readings relate to house and home, but いえ is a bit more for the physical building (the house) while うち is more for your personal sense of home, including your family and household.
481 | 私 | わたし | I | Me | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n If you're lucky, you already know this (very) common word's reading. It's the word for "I," probably one of the first things you'd learn in Japanese. The reading for this is わたし. If you don't know that already, just think: "What, a し?" referring to the reading of the kanji, which is し.
482 | 国王 | こくおう | King | Monarch\n Sovereign | A country king is still a king, just of a bigger area. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
483 | 天国 | てんごく | Kingdom Of Heaven | Heaven\n Paradise | This is heaven country. Where is that? Probably just in heaven (or if you want to be fancy, the kingdom of heaven). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The 国 is changed to the reading ごく though because of rendaku. Even heaven changes a little bit.
484 | 九州 | きゅうしゅう | Kyuushuu | Kyushu | The nine states. This refers to a section of Japan from a long time ago that was presumably made up of nine states. Now it's just one big island, though, and that island is Kyuushuu. Go take a look at a map and find this giant island, it's a cool part of Japan! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
485 | 土地 | とち | Land |  | The soil of the earth is the portion of the earth that is made up of land. \n The reading is the on'yomi reading, but 土 gets modified to と for some reason. Just remember that the land you're standing on is made of toes... millions of them. Yuck.
486 | 生活 | せいかつ | Life | Livelihood | When you have life and are lively that right there is true life. What is your 生活 like? Do you live? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
487 | 長い | ながい | Long |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of long? It's also long. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have something that's really long. It's this crazy hair growing out of the tip of your nose. You don't really care either way if it stays or goes, but you're too lazy to cut it off. Your parents, though, keep trying to nag (なが) you to trim it. Imagine this process happening and be irritated about it. What naggers.
488 | 宝くじ | たからくじ | Lottery | Public Lottery\n Lottery Ticket | 宝 is a treasure. くじ is a lottery. So if you have a treasure lottery (you win treasure if you win the lottery) then you have yourself a lottery. \n The reading uses the 宝 vocab reading, たから.
489 | 小文字 | こもじ | Lowercase Letters | Lowercase Characters\n Lowercase | You know that 文字 means "letters". So, what are "small letters"? That would be lowercase letters. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. However, 小 uses the kun'yomi reading and 文 is an exception here, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember this:\nYou learned your lowercase letters from 子 Moe (こも). That's right, after Moe taught you all the letters, his son 子 Moe taught you the lowercase ones. Such teamwork.
490 | 地図 | ちず | Map |  | The diagram of the earth. What could that be other than a map? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
491 | 草地 | くさち | Meadow | Grassland | Grass covering the earth is a meadow. Or, if you're less creative, it's grassland. \n The reading is a combination of kun'yomi and on'yomi readings. That being said, both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this.
492 | 水星 | すいせい | Mercury |  | The water star is the planet Mercury. That's where we hid all of our secret moon water. Mercury looks enough like our moon, so we put it there so no one could find it. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
493 | 中東 | ちゅうとう | Middle East |  | The middle of the east is more simply known as the middle east. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
494 | 死亡 | しぼう | Mortality | Death | Death and deceased. That's a lot of death. This is mortality. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
495 | 国宝 | こくほう | National Treasure | Nic Cage | A country's treasure is their national treasure. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
496 | 全国 | ぜんこく | Nationwide | National\n Countrywide | When something involves all the country you know it's nationwide or national. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
497 | 首 | くび | Neck |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n You learned the reading for this word via the kanji, so you should be able to read this word just fine.
498 | 夜 | よる | Night | Evening | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nIt is the night, but it is your (よる) night.
499 | 直行 | ちょっこう | Nonstop | Direct | If you think about direct going (aka transportation) how would you make it better? You'd make it so everything was nonstop and direct. Just imagine how much nicer it would be if every airplane you took was direct and you never had to stop. So nice!\nNote 直行 is commonly used in business settings to describe traveling directly to a destination without making any stops, like visiting a client’s office straight from your home. \n This is a jukugo word and uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. The ちょく of 直 is shortened with a small っ, though, so make sure to take note of that.
500 | 足りない | たりない | Not Enough | Insufficient\n Not Sufficient | You know the word 足りる from Level 4. What is this one? it's the opposite (negative form on a verb is ない). So, what is the opposite of 足りる (To be sufficient)? The opposite is to not be sufficient or not enough. \n The reading is the same as 足りる (たりる) which you should have seen in Level 4.
501 | ない | ない | Not There | Not Exist | The knife (ない) is not there. It's not here and it's not there. It’s missing. It's nowhere to be found, so don't bother looking for it!
502 | 年上 | としうえ | Older |  | When you're years above someone else, you are older than that person. \n The reading for this one is an exception, because it uses kun'yomi readings even though it is a jukugo kanji. You already know the separate kun'yomi readings from the vocabulary of the last level, but you will have to remember to actually use this knowledge when this word comes up.
503 | 姉 | あね | Older Sister | Big Sister\n Elder Sister | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is your older sister, by the way. Not somebody else's. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet,  so here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\nPicture your older sister (even if you don't have one), her birthday is coming up and there's only one thing she wants from you. A necklace (あね). She's wanted a necklace for years and you're finally going to give her one. She'll be so happy.
504 | お姉さん | おねえさん | Older Sister | Miss | The お makes the word more polite. You're elevating the "older sister" title because you're a good younger sibling. Otherwise, the meaning of this word is the same as the kanji - just the feeling is different. You can also use this word to refer to a youthful-looking woman that you don't know, as in "Excuse me miss!" \n The reading is different too. It has some hiragana attached to it, which is a clue that this uses a kun'yomi reading. Let's use a mnemonic to learn that reading.\nImagine your older sister (even if you don't have one). She is, for some reason, a horse. Imagine petting her, giving her carrots, and doing other horse-related things with her. What do horses say? They say nehhhh (ねえ).
505 | 一歩 | いっぽ | One Step |  | If 歩 is "walk" and you take one walk, then really you are just taking one step. When there's a number before 歩, it refers to the number of steps you're taking. The most common is this one, and you'll see it on urinals when they kindly ask you to please take one step forward because peeing isn't a game and somebody has to clean up after you. \n The reading is pretty standard in its trickiness. The いち shortens to an いっ and the ほ rendakus to ぽ. One step at a time, right?
506 | 元 | もと | Origin | Ex\n Former | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. When it's used as a prefix, it takes on the related meaning of ex- or former. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou're trying to trace a person back to their origin so you can learn more about them. You finally get there - it's a castle. The problem is that it's surrounded by a huge moat (もと) and you can't get past it because the drawbridge is up. Feel the frustration of this. Think about your goal and how close you are to getting to it if it wasn't for this lousy moat.
507 | 海外 | かいがい | Overseas | Foreign\n Abroad | The outside of the sea is someplace overseas. It can also be foreign or abroad if those words are easier to remember for you. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
508 | 平安 | へいあん | Peace | Peaceful\n Heian | Something is flat and relaxed. That is you. What words does that describe? To me, that would be peace. Just imagine something that is flat and relaxed, like a field of grass with happy people in it. It's so peaceful!\nThis is the way you write the Heian period of Japanese history, which is probably where you'll see this word the most. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
509 | 私生活 | しせいかつ | Personal Life | One's Personal Life\n Private Life\n One's Private Life | You've seen 生活 before, right? So what about the "life" of I? Whose life is that? Why, that's my own personal life. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
510 | 午後 | ごご | PM | Afternoon\n P.M. | What is noon after? That is PM or the afternoon. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
511 | 点 | てん | Point | Score\n Decimal Point\n Viewpoint | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. As luck would have it, this word actually covers most of the meanings of the English word point, too! So it can mean things like score, viewpoint, and decimal point. \n The reading for this word is the same as the reading for the kanji that makes it.
512 | 豚肉 | ぶたにく | Pork |  | A pig's meat is called pork. \n The readings are the ones you learned with the kanji.
513 | 私立 | しりつ | Private |  | The place where I stand is my own private area. Think of the "circle of personal space." This is where you stand plus an arm's length. This area is very private to you. Who knows what you do in your own private area. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.\nBoth 市立 (municipal) and 私立 (private) are pronounced as しりつ and it's hard to tell them apart when speaking. Although they're not official readings, people sometimes distinguish 市立 and 私立 by pronouncing them as いちりつ and わたくしりつ respectively.
514 | 車両 | しゃりょう | Railroad Car | Vehicle\n Train Car\n Railway Carriage\n Railcar | A car with more cars on both sides is a car that hooks into other cars... specifically other railroad cars. They have hooks on both sides, they hook into other cars, and they fit all the requirements of this vocab word's kanji. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
515 | 安心 | あんしん | Relief | Peace Of Mind | When your heart is relaxed, how do you feel? What if this is after something startling happens? You would feel relief or peace of mind. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
516 | 〜室 | しつ | Room |  | You'll see this attached to other words... like "waiting" or "guest." When you see this, you'll know it is a ___ room, making this word mean room (same as the kanji). \n The reading is the on'yomi reading. Don't type the 〜 out when writing the answer. It's just there to let you know that there's usually something attached to this word.
517 | 安全 | あんぜん | Safety | Safe | When you are all relaxed you are finally safe and in safety. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
518 | 土星 | どせい | Saturn |  | The ground star is Saturn. That's why it's called "sat"urn. Because the first people to find it sat on the ground there. It's a star made completely of sit-on-able ground. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
519 | 科学 | かがく | Science |  | The study of science is plainly known as science. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
520 | 羊 | ひつじ | Sheep |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nImagine a sheep fighting with Jesus. The first thing it does is hits Jesus (ひつじ) in the stomach with its fists, then hits Jesus again with its horns. Try to imagine this playing out, with an announcer calling the shots as well.
521 | 四国 | しこく | Shikoku |  | The four country is another section of Japan. It's quite nice, too. Look on a map and try to find it. So, the meaning of this word is also the reading, which you should be able to figure out because it's all on'yomi: Shikoku. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You've learned them already, so you should be able to read this on your own!
522 | 店 | みせ | Shop | Store | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThink of your favorite shop. Okay, now imagine yourself going to it. When you arrive, the entire shop is totally missing (みせ). Feel the shock and awe of this. It's as if it picked up and left overnight. No building, no anything. Just missing.
523 | 姉妹 | しまい | Sisters |  | Your older sister and your younger sister. These are your sisters. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
524 | 石ころ | いしころ | Small Stone | Pebble\n Stone | You've already learned 石, which means stone. Add a ころ to that, and it becomes a small stone, or pebble. \n This uses the kun'yomi of 石, which you've already learned, and adds a bit of hiragana, so you should be able to read this!
525 | 他の人 | ほかのひと | Someone Else | Other People | Here you have other and person joined together by the particle の, which shows that "other" is describing "person". So this means someone else or other people.\nThis is more general than 他人, which you already learned. 他の人 can be anyone that's not the speaker, or not the person being talked about. 他人, on the other hand, has an added implication that the person is someone unknown or unrelated. \n This uses the kanji's kun'yomi readings, which you've already learned. As long as you remember those, you should be good to go!
526 | 南 | みなみ | South |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThink about the south. What's down there? Mean Amy (みなみ) lives down there. Think of the last mean thing she did to you and imagine it while yelling out "MEAN AMYYYYY" at the sky.
527 | 南東 | なんとう | Southeast |  | The South East is the Southeast. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
528 | 州 | しゅう | State | Province\n County | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the on'yomi reading that you learned with the kanji, probably because it normally gets added on to other things, like the names of the state. Examples: カリフォルニア州, ニューヨーク州, etc.
529 | 代用 | だいよう | Substitution |  | A substitute task is a substitution.\nNote that this word has a slightly formal feel to it. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
530 | タクシー | タクシー | Taxi | Cab | タクシー is the katakana version of the English word taxi. The "xi" sound becomes クシー to fit better with Japanese pronunciation.
531 | お茶 | おちゃ | Tea |  | The お just makes the word more polite. Since tea is so important in Japan, it gets the お. Otherwise, you should be able to figure out the meaning as it's the same as the kanji. \n The reading is the on'yomi reading, just like you learned with the kanji.
532 | あれ | あれ | That One Over There | Those Ones Over There | You need a lens (あれ)? How about that one over there? You’re in a camera shop picking out a new lens, and that one over there looks good.\nUse あれ to refer to something that's far from both you and the person you're talking to.
533 | この | この | This | These | Remember how これ means "this one"? Well, この simply means this. The difference is that これ is used on its own, whereas この goes before a noun. For example, この人 means "this person".\nNotice how words like this starting with こ are close to you? We'll be learning a few more of these, and they all follow the same pattern!
534 | 今年 | ことし | This Year |  | The now year is which year? It is this year. \n With the first reading (the more common one), the こん of 今 is actually just こ. This gets shortened sometimes, so look out for it. Also, the 年 is the kun'yomi reading for some reason. It's a total mystery why this is. Perhaps the ancient aliens know, but I do not. You're going to have to remember this exception with that brain of yours and rely on the SRS to bestow this knowledge upon you.\nThe second reading, which is less common but still common enough, makes more sense. It is こんねん and just follows the jukugo patterns.
535 | 三百 | さんびゃく | Three Hundred |  | You have three hundreds. What does that come out to? Three hundred. \n The reading is a little bit weird, so be careful. You should already know the on'yomi readings, but the ひゃく rendakus to びゃく. This pattern will repeat itself with 三 + many counter kanjis that can rendaku, so pay attention for it as you read Japanese.
536 | 足す | たす | To Add Something |  | Remember 足りる? That is "to be enough." How can you make something be enough? You keep adding things to the pile until you reach that point where there are enough! That's why this verb is to add something, because you keep adding things until you 足りる.\nThis verb is transitive, like most verbs ending in す, which is why you are adding something. It's not getting itself added all by itself. Maybe you add so much that someone tries to sue (す) you for that nasty pile of squirrels you keep outside. \n The reading is the same as 足りる, so if you know that you can add things up to this.
537 | 出来る | できる | To Be Able To Do | To Be Ready\n To Be Made | When you exit and come, apparently it means to be able to do. I think of it like you're leaving a location (出) to do a task and then you come (来る) back after you did it. Perhaps you were waiting in a room training like someone from Dragonball. When you leave the room, you are ready to fight the enemy and win. You train in that room to be able to do whatever you need to do, and only leave and come back alive because you were able to do it.\nThis verb is really common and it has a wide range of meanings. It can also mean things like to be ready, for example a meal, and to be made, for example when saying what something is made from. It's commonly written in hiragana, but you'll see the kanji version too! \n The readings are a bit strange. They're both kun'yomi readings, where 出 is で and 来る is きる. This is different from the reading you originally learned with 来る (くる), though, so be careful. If you can remember that and remember the kun'yomi readings from the previous vocab, you should be able to learn this one's reading as well.
538 | 切れる | きれる | To Be Cut | To Snap\n To Expire\n To Run Out | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means cut so this generally means that something is cut. Something breaks or snaps. No direct object here. That's why this verb means to be cut or to snap. Another meaning of this verb is to expire or to run out. This could be various things like your passport, or a deadline for an assignment. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. Here's a refresher to help you remember the  き portion of this word:\nSomething is snapping. Turns out that something is your arm. Your arm is a 木 (き) that grew out of you one day. "What's this ki doing here?" you ask. Then it suddenly breaks in half! "OW OW OW! My ki! It's been cut!!"
539 | 写る | うつる | To Be Photographed | To Be In A Photograph | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means copy, but what is a copy? It is basically a photograph, which is why this word means to be photographed, or to be in a photograph. You know this one is "to be photographed" because it ends with a る. Someone thinks you're "rude" so they're photographing you. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the うつ part. You're being rude, right? That's why you got photographed. Why are you rude? You're doing beatboxing, constantly saying うつうつうつ over and over again. Say it out loud, too.
540 | 行う | おこなう | To Carry Something Out | To Perform Something | The meaning of this word is pretty strange, having very little to do with the kanji meaning you learned. This word means to carry something out. Maybe you can think of it like someone is saying "You (う) go do that task!" to get yourself to carry out the task. Whatever you do, just know this is a weird exception word, so you may have to do some extra work to remember it. \n The reading is also a strange exception. You have to remember the おこな portion. Maybe this mnemonic will help:\nYou have to carry out a task but don’t know how. “Oh, Conan!” (おこな) you shout. You always shout “Oh, Conan!” when you have to carry out something tough, because it summons the spirit of Detective Conan. He’s a genius, so his spirit can help you with anything at all. Even your WaniKani reviews. Go ahead and try it now. Shout “Oh, Conan!” Did you do it? Good. Now carry out those reviews!
541 | 死ぬ | しぬ | To Die |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means death, so the verb version is to die. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
542 | 食べる | たべる | To Eat |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means eat so the verb version is to eat. \n You have to remember the た portion if you want to be able to read this word, which uses the kun'yomi reading. Think about yourself eating some tacos (た). Imagine yourself eating it, that raw beef taste in your mouth (either like it or hate it).
543 | 直す | なおす | To Fix | To Repair\n To Fix Something\n To Repair Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means fix so this vocab word means to fix. This is when you're fixing something, as in doing the actual physical action of fixing. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to learn the なお part. Think of it this way. You need to fix something! It's urgent! You have to fix it now! (なお). This will also work with the similar word, 直る, which you'll learn soon if you haven't already.
544 | 首になる | くびになる | To Get Fired | To Get Sacked | The になる part means "to become," so literally this means "to become neck." If you think about it, when something becomes neck, it has to do with you getting your head cut off (at the neck). But, in today's modern society we don't do that too often. Instead, this means you lose your job, aka to get fired. \n This word contains the reading you learned with the kanji. Everything else is hiragana.
545 | 生える | はえる | To Grow | To Spring Up\n To Sprout\n To Come Out | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. Remember how 生きる means "to live?" Well this is what happens right after it starts to live. It begins to grow! \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhen something starts to grow it also learns to laugh. Imagine a little plant growing out of the ground laughing. "Ha (は) ha ha ha!" it says, as it sprouts out of the ground.
546 | 有る | ある | To Have | To Exist | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means have and so the verb version means to have. An alternative meaning is to exist though this refers only to non-living inanimate things, not moving and living things. So really, this is similar to "to have" as well.\nThe kanji isn't used too often for this word, so when you're writing just use the kana. But you'll see the kanji used sometimes so it's important to be able to recognize it! \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nTo have something is very nice. But now, the only thing you possess are screams. Imagine this. You are in a totally empty room with no possessions. You open a little box and look inside. It contains screams that yell: "AAAAHHHH" (あ).
547 | 東北 | とうほく | Tohoku | Tohoku Region\n Northeast Region | The East North area of Japan is called Tohoku or the Tohoku region. It was the region hit by the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. This can also mean northeast region when talking about China or Japan, but for other countries (and for the direction) we'd use 北東. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
548 | 知る | しる | To Know | To Learn\n To Find Out | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means know so the verb version means to know. It can additionally refer to how one comes to know something, so it also means to learn or to find out. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou want to know everything there is to know about sheep (し). Why? Because you are a busybody who wants to know everything. But for now, you'll settle for sheep. Right now all you know is that sheep are soft, come in many colors, and that they have 360 degree vision with their weird, rectangle eyes. There's even more to know, so you better get on it!
549 | 東京 | とうきょう | Tokyo | Toukyou | The East Capital in Japan is Tokyo. If you look on a map and compare it to 京都 (Kyoto, the other capital in history), you'll see it's East of Kyoto, making it the East Capital, Tokyo. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
550 | 今夜 | こんや | Tonight | This Evening | The now night is the current night, aka tonight. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
551 | 亡くなる | なくなる | To Pass Away | To Become Deceased\n To Die | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. This word is actually two words put together, though. 亡く means "be deceased." なる means "to become." So put that all together and you have to pass away or to become deceased. It's basically a polite way to say something died (死ぬ). \n To learn to read this kanji you have to remember the な part of 亡く, though our mnemonic will use the whole thing.\nIf you're about to become deceased, you are probably knocking (なく) on death's door.
552 | 広がる | ひろがる | To Spread Out | To Extend\n To Stretch | Remember 広い? Well this is like that, except a verb. When something does the action of getting wide, it means to spread out, to extend, or to stretch.\nYou already learned 広げる, which is used when YOU spread something. 広がる, on the other hand, means that something spreads out all on its own. It's worth mentioning that lots of intransitive verbs end in がる, and this is no exception. Just think how about a girl (がる) you know can do everything all by herself. She never needs help from anyone else. \n The reading is the same as 広い, too, so as long as you knew that you knew this reading as well.
553 | 取る | とる | To Take | To Take Something\n To Get Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means take, so the verb version is to take something. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You already know this kun'yomi reading, so you should be able to read this word.
554 | 思う | おもう | To Think |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means think so the verb version is to think. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned that reading with this kanji, but here's a reminder of the mnemonic just in case:\nYou have to remember the おも part to read this word. To do this, though, you'll have to think about that guy... hmm... what was his name? He's on The Simpsons... he's the bartender? I think? Oh! Moe (おも) is his name! Thank you. Now I remember.\nIf you don't know Moe from the Simpsons use a different Moe, perhaps the one from the Three Stooges? You should be able to come up with one.
555 | 向く | むく | To Turn Toward | To Face\n To Be Suitable | You know that the kanji means yonder, which is like "over there." This is the verb version of "yonder." That being said, "to yonder" isn't really a thing, so you have to think of what happens when you "look yonder." This word means to turn toward or to face. You're looking yonder, but you have to turn towards said yonder to look that way.\nThis word can also mean to be suitable, as in a good fit for a job, role, or situation. After all, you turn toward the things you’re most suitable for, right? \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou turn to face a new direction and look out into the distance. There is a single cow out there. It turns to face you too, and says moo (む).
556 | 歩く | あるく | To Walk |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means walk so the verb version means to walk. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the ある portion. Imagine yourself going to walk outside. But, as you walk, you walk like a pirate. You have a peg leg, a parrot, and a hook. Lastly, you say "arrrrr" (ある). Go ahead, say it out loud while walking around your room like a pirate. It will help.
557 | 曲 | きょく | Tune | Piece Of Music\n Song\n Melody | This almost shares the meaning with the kanji. It's essentially the same thing, though when it's alone it refers to a specific piece of music (aka a tune). \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji as well, so you should be able to read it.
558 | 地中 | ちちゅう | Underground | Subterranean | If you're in the middle of the ground, then you're most likely underground. Are you a moleperson? That's pretty cool. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
559 | 地下 | ちか | Underground | Basement\n Cellar | Below the ground is underground. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

561 | 米国 | べいこく | United States Of America | United States\n America\n USA | America is the country of rice. I guess this is from all those rolling plains and such we have. Another way to say America in Japanese is アメリカ, but this is another more formal (and older) way. "Rice Country" aka United States Of America, United States, America, or USA. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
562 | 不明 | ふめい | Unknown | Unclear\n Uncertain\n Unsure | Something that is not bright is cloudy and fuzzy. What do you think when you look into the fuzzy clouds? It is the unknown, the unclear, the uncertain. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
563 | 大文字 | おおもじ | Uppercase Letters | Capital Letters\n Uppercase | You have big writing letters. What do you think these are? THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE UPPERCASE LETTERS, RIGHT? Whoops, sorry, caps lock was on for a moment, there. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. However, 大 uses the kun'yomi reading and 文 is an exception here, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember this:\nWhenever you see an uppercase letter, you shout "おお, Moe!" (おおも). Your buddy Moe taught you the letters in the first place, so when you get stuck, you yell for him to come help you. And he always does. What a good guy.
564 | 金星 | きんせい | Venus |  | The gold star is Venus. It's the only planet in our solar system that's the same color as gold. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
565 | どの | どの | Which |  | Remember how どれ means "which one"? どの has a very similar meaning: which. Whereas どれ is used on its own, どの is used before a noun to ask "which" out of three or more options. So for example, どの本 is "which book (out of that pile)?".\nNotice how question words often start with a ど? We'll be seeing more of these!
566 | 耳打ち | みみうち | Whisper In Ear | Whisper In One's Ear | You feel your ear getting… hit? This is the feeling of a whisper in your ear; perhaps a secret, or some other confidential tidbit of information. Whatever it is it has impact, which is why it feels like a hit!\nNote that this word is more often used in writing than in casual speech. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, but you know them both now, so you should be able to read this too!
567 | 冬休み | ふゆやすみ | Winter Holiday | Winter Break\n Winter Vacation | The winter rest! Wait, nobody calls it that. This is a winter holiday or winter break. \n The readings for these are both the kun'yomi readings. Hopefully you learned them when you were doing vocab in the previous levels so that all you have to do now is combine the two separate words into one bigger word. Please don't take a winter break until you figure this word out.
568 | 羊毛 | ようもう | Wool |  | A sheep's fur is wool. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
569 | 手首 | てくび | Wrist |  | Your hand's neck is your wrist! \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings from both kanji, probably because it includes body parts. You know them both already, so now you know this too!
570 | 年下 | としした | Younger |  | When you have someone who has years below your own, this person is younger than you. \n The reading for this one is kind of strange. It is the kun'yomi reading for both of the kanji. You know the kun'yomi readings from earlier, back when you learned the vocab 年 and 下.
571 | 妹 | いもうと | Younger Sister | Little Sister | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYour younger sister is really into emotes (いもうと). Look up this word if you're not a teenage girl. Just imagine her sending you these on your phone over and over. You tell your younger sister: "HEY, STOP SENDING ME EMOTES."
572 | 以後 | いご | After This | From Now On\n After\n Since | From after, just means after this or from now on. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
573 | この辺 | このへん | Around Here | This Area | この means "this" so この辺 just means this area. \n The reading for the kanji portion is just what you've already learned with the kanji 辺 so this shouldn't be a difficult one to read for you.
574 | 先回り | さきまわり | Arriving Ahead | Going Ahead\n Anticipation | If you get there previous to something rotating (回り), you are arriving ahead, or going ahead in anticipation. \n This consists of a couple kun'yomi readings put together. You can tell it's kun'yomi because of the hiragana sticking out at the end. In previous levels, you learned both the words 先 and 回る (verb version of 回り). If you know those, you should be able to put them together to learn the reading of this word as well.
575 | 風船 | ふうせん | Balloon |  | A wind boat. This is a strange one for sure. You may assume this is like one of those giant balloons you can go ride around in, and you'd be partly right. Really, this word covers the general word balloon, though it especially has to do with the toy-style balloons (or smaller balloons). It's a little round wind ship! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
576 | 〜札 | さつ | Bill | Note | The kanji and the word are almost exactly the same. When you see this word after a number, it’s for physical bills of money. \n This is a suffix that takes the on’yomi reading, which you’ve learned already!\nYou'll also see this pronounced ふだ, but that's when it's a standalone word or part of a compound, rather than a suffix. So if you answer with that reading, you'll be prompted to enter the suffix reading instead.
577 | 鳥 | とり | Bird |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nWhen you think about birds, what is the most common bird you can think of? What bird do you hate the most or like eating the most? Either one will work. Now, imagine yourself going up to that bird. You did something terrible. You tore (とり) off its wing and started eating it (pretend it's cooked first, if that makes you less nauseous).
578 | 黒い | くろい | Black |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of black? It's also black. Special Note: The noun version of black also exists in Japanese. It is just 黒 with the same pronunciation, but minus the い which makes it adjective-tastic. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThink of black things. One very common black thing is the common crow (くろ). Associate those two together.
579 | 黒人 | こくじん | Black Person | Black People | A black person is simply a Black person, kind of like how a 白人 is a "White person," but a different  color. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nImagine a Black person you know well wearing coke jeans (こくじん). Yep, jeans made entirely from coke bottles. That's actually a thing. Look it up if you don't believe me.
580 | 青空 | あおぞら | Blue Sky |  | This is simply a blue sky (aka a blue sky!). \n You'd think that this word would use on'yomi readings to read it, but it doesn't (shake that angry fist at the kanji gods!). Instead, it's double kun'yomi, probably because this word is really like two separate words put together, "blue" and "sky." In the previous level you unlocked these two separate words, learning their readings. That means you should be able to read this as well.\nOne quick note is the rendaku-fication of 空 as well. It becomes ぞら.
581 | 船 | ふね | Boat | Ship | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou're riding in a boat. It's great. Imagine it being the best time you've had in your life. You tell everyone: "This is fun, eh?" (ふね). You're on a Canadian ship, which is why you add the "eh" in there. Say this out loud wherever you are right now while imagining the sea smell, the wind, and the excitement of boats.
582 | 教室 | きょうしつ | Classroom |  | The teaching room is just a classroom. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
583 | 活用形 | かつようけい | Conjugated Form |  | You know that 活用 means "conjugation" and that 〜形 means "form," so that means this is the conjugated form! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
584 | 日記 | にっき | Diary | Journal | When you write down your day (and do it every day) that's your diary. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 日 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nWhen you write down your day in your diary, in fact you write only about Nicky (にっき). You love Nicky so much, your diary is full of Nicky this, Nicky that. Ah, Nicky is just the best.
585 | 〜丁目 | ちょうめ | District Of A Town | City Block\n Town District\n District | A street you can see with your eye isn't soooo big you can't see it (like a town would be), but it's still pretty big because it has a street. This section of the town is the district of a town, or a city block (though specifically one of an irregular size). \n The readings are the ones you learned with the kanji, so use those and you'll be A-Okay.
586 | 人形 | にんぎょう | Doll | Puppet | Something that is person shaped that isn't a person? That has to be some kind of doll or puppet. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, and the reading of 形 is a bit of an oddball, here's a mnemonic to help you:\nDid you know that all dolls at Nintendo are made out of gyoza dumplings (にんぎょう)? They'll also regularly try to get you to eat them... Mmmm, gyoza dolls. Don't be afraid to take a bite!
587 | 小学生 | しょうがくせい | Elementary School Student | Primary School Student | You know 学生 is student, so what is a small student? Think young. That would be an Elementary School Student. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
588 | 象 | ぞう | Elephant |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the ぞう reading of the kanji. You're at the ぞう show. How exciting.
589 | 月末 | げつまつ | End Of The Month | Month End | You know how 月 can also mean month? If you add 末 on there you have the "month end" aka the end of the month. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 月 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nWhen it's the end of the month, everybody gets mats (げつまつ). We don't pay people in money at Tofugu, but everyone gets mats at the month end instead.
590 | 魚 | さかな | Fish |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nImagine a fish. Now imagine the fish playing soccer, while wearing a nun's outfit. This is a soccer nun (さかな).
591 | 床 | ゆか | Floor |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji, but here’s a mnemonic in case you need a refresher:\nYou look at the floor. It's disgusting. Dirtiest and nastiest floor you've ever seen. You say yucka (ゆか) because it's covered in yucca (ゆか). Plus, it's all rotten. Yucka!
592 | 必死 | ひっし | Frantic | Desperate\n Certain Death\n Sure Death | Your future consists of certain death. How would you feel in this situation? Probably very frantic and desperate.\nAnother translation for this word is simply certain death, though I'd rather you learn one of the first two before this one if you can. \n The readings are the on'yomi readings, though 必 (ひつ) gets shortened to ひっ. In your desperate situation just imagine that you're trying to get out of it, and to do so you move the つ only to find a smaller っ blocking your way. It is certain death.
593 | 自由 | じゆう | Freedom | Liberty | When you have self reason, you are able to think for yourself. When you can think for yourself, you have freedom. Very philosophical, this vocab is. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
594 | 氏名 | しめい | Full Name | First And Last Name | Both of these kanji have to do with names. You have both family name and name. Both of those names together makes for a First And Last Name... a full name if you will. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
595 | 未来 | みらい | Future | The Future\n Distant Future\n The Distant Future | What has not yet come? The future.\n未来 is usually used to talk about the distant future, and it implies that the future can’t be foreseen. So you can use it to speculate about what might lie ahead, but you probably wouldn’t use it to discuss more concrete plans, goals or predictions. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
596 | 地理 | ちり | Geography |  | The reason the earth is the way it is is because of the geography of it. Though it may seem kind of strange that geography is bringing reason to the earth, if you think of geography as a study, then you can think about how you try to get reason through that, as well. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
597 | 金魚 | きんぎょ | Goldfish |  | A gold fish is really just gold in color, but it's still called a goldfish. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
598 | 組 | くみ | Group | Team\n Class | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. That's the reading you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this one too. If you need a refresher, here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou're part of a special group. It is the cumin group, and they deal with all things cumin (the spice or seed). Smell the cumin. Touch it. Taste it. You live and breathe the stuff, because you are the president of this cumin group.\nP.S. This can also be spelled 組み (same overall reading: くみ).
599 | 手作り | てづくり | Handmade | Homemade | When something is hand made, it is handmade! \n The readings for these kanji are the kun'yomi readings. Just think of this word as two separate words put together (手 and 作る). The る in 作る gets changed to り because it's an adjective, and the つ in つくり gets changed to づ because of the way the words are combined with each other. You should know most of the reading that is in this word, though it will probably take a little bit of thinking to sort out the little changes in those readings.
600 | 大空 | おおぞら | Heavens | Firmament\n Sky\n Skies | The big thing in the sky is the heavens. The heavens where birds and planes soar, not the one you go to after you die if you've been really good. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own. Just remember that そら becomes ぞら because of rendaku here.
601 | 高校 | こうこう | High School | Senior High School | The tall school is for when your kids get about as tall as they're going to get. That's high school, when most people stop growing taller. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
602 | 作り方 | つくりかた | How To Make | Way To Make\n Way Of Making | This is the way to make something. This is how to make something. You'll see this for directions on building something. \n This uses the kun'yomi readings from the vocab words 作る and 方. So as long as you're okay with those, you can apply that knowledge over here.
603 | 船体 | せんたい | Hull | Ship Hull | A boat's body is called the hull. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
604 | 人里 | ひとざと | Human Habitation | Village | A person's hometown is a human habitation, or a village. This word has a slightly old-fashioned feel, and it's usually used for small villages in the countryside.\nIt's often combined with はなれた (separated) to talk about how far away from the nearest human habitation something is. \n This jukugo uses the kun'yomi of the kanji instead of the more usual on'yomi. You learned both of these readings when you learned the vocabulary 人 and 里. Just notice that さと becomes ざと, because of rendaku.
605 | 大きく | おおきく | In A Big Way | On A Grand Scale | This is the adverb version of the kanji big. It's a little thing you can put in front of things to say that they are "in a big way" or "on a grand scale." \n Since you already know the reading of the vocab word 大きい, you should be able to read this word as well.
606 | 内ポケット | うちぽけっと | Inside Pocket |  | Your inside ポケット is your inside pocket. \n This word uses the kun'yomi for the kanji. You learned that reading when you learned the word 内.
607 | 近々 | ちかぢか | In The Near Future | Soon | When something is close close (the 々 character repeats the kanji that was before it) it will happen in the near future, or soon.\nThis is pretty vague, and it's up to the person speaking to decide how soon soon is. Depending on the person and the situation, it could technically be used for anything up to a few years! \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading twice; that's the one you learn with the vocab word 近い from the previous level. The second 近 gets converted to ぢか, though, so take note of that. To write the character ぢ, type "di" on your keyboard.
608 | 木星 | もくせい | Jupiter |  | The tree star is the planet Jupiter. Imagine Jupiter covered in very strange trees — the kind that are able to take root in gas! It's a pretty weird image, but will hopefully help you to remember this word. Alternatively, think about how the clouds around Jupiter make patterns that look a lot like wood grain. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
609 | 先週 | せんしゅう | Last Week |  | The previous week was last week. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
610 | 以下 | いか | Less Than | Or Less\n Not Exceeding\n Below | Compared with this, it's below. That's another way to say that what you have is less than it. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
611 | 手紙 | てがみ | Letter |  | A hand paper is a letter because letters are generally written by hand on paper.\nIf you want a more graphic image, imagine writing a letter on your hand, and how much it would hurt to chop off your hand and send it. \n The reading is double kun'yomi (body parts tend to make kanji in words change to a kun'yomi reading). Both kanji in this word had you learn that reading right from the start, though, so you should be able to read this word. Just watch out for the rendaku making it がみ, not かみ.
612 | 小声 | こごえ | Low Voice | Whisper | A small voice is so small that you can hardly hear it. It's a low voice or a whisper. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own. Just watch out because, like in 大声, the こえ becomes ごえ thanks to our old friend rendaku.
613 | 火星 | かせい | Mars |  | The fire star is Mars. This should be easy to remember, because Mars is the only planet in our solar system that's the color of fire. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
614 | 心理 | しんり | Mental State | Psychology | The reasoning of your heart decides what you do. Probably when kanji was being made people thought that the heart directed our actions, not our brains. So, if you think about it that way, the reasoning of your heart is your mental state. Nowadays that's known as psychology. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
615 | 中学生 | ちゅうがくせい | Middle School Student | Junior High School Student | You've seen 学生 (means student). Now let's look at a student who's in the middle. Perhaps we can call this a middle school student or a junior high school student, depending on where you're from. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
616 | 〜分 | ふん | Minute | Minutes | What's part of an hour? A minute, or minutes! This word is the suffix version of 分, so it goes after numbers to say how many minutes, and is used for telling the time too. \n This uses a different on'yomi than what you learned with the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember this reading:\nHow many minutes of fun (ふん) will you have today? Lots and lots of minutes, I hope!\nDepending on the number before 分, its pronunciation can change to ぷん, because of rendaku. We're looking for the original reading ふん here though!
617 | 〜氏 | し | Mister | Madam\n Miss\n Mx | The kanji means family name because it goes after a family name in very formal situations. So, it's really closely tied to that. Because only men got the respect back in the day, we're calling this vocab word mister. You can call me Mr. Koichi if you'd like, too. \n The reading for this word is the same as the kanji.
618 | 以上 | いじょう | More Than | Or More\n That's All | Compared with something else, this is above. That's another way to say that what you have is more than something else. That's all. ;) \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
619 | 映画 | えいが | Movie | Film | It's a reflection of an image on a screen, and the image is moving! What is this? It's a movie. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
620 | ナポレオン三世 | なぽれおんさんせい | Napoleon The Third | Napoleon III | Adding "third generation" to someone's name means that they are the third generation of people with that name. In this case, the person's name is ナポレオン (Napoleon), so this means Napoleon The Third, also written as Napoleon III. \n The kanji here are pronounced exactly the same as in the standalone word 三世. That is, it's a jukugo word which uses the on'yomi for both kanji.
621 | 近く | ちかく | Near | Neighborhood\n Vicinity\n Nearly\n Shortly | This is the noun version of the kanji near. So it also means near, or in the neighborhood of something. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading when you learned 近い, so you should be able to read this word as well.
622 | 海王星 | かいおうせい | Neptune |  | The ocean king's star is Neptune! If you know anything about Roman mythology this should be easy to remember! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
623 | 正月 | しょうがつ | New Year | New Year's Holidays\n Japanese New Year | You correct the moon because it's a New Year. It's the beginning of a fresh year, so you gotta have the moon in the correct position.\nThis usually refers to the first few days of a new year, and it's one of the biggest holidays in Japan. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Both of these kanji have a couple of on'yomi readings, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember which ones to use:\nAt New Year, you hate your Shougun's guts (しょうがつ). He doesn't celebrate New Year, you see, so none of you get any time off. He even started a war last New Year and ruined everyone's holidays. No wonder you hate that shougun's guts.
624 | 来週 | らいしゅう | Next Week |  | The next week is the next week. It isn't last week or this week, it's the next one! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
625 | 海魚 | かいぎょ | Ocean Fish | Saltwater Fish | An ocean fish is simply an ocean fish. They also happen to be the most delicious kind of fish. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.\nSome people also use the kun'yomi readings, but it's much less common, and generally considered colloquial.
626 | 〜時 | じ | O'Clock |  | If there's a number before 時, it means o'clock. For example １時 is 1:00, and ２３時 is 23:00 or 11pm. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
627 | お兄さん | おにいさん | Older Brother | Guy | This word starts with an お to make it more polite. Then it has the kanji 兄 which you already know. Lastly, it has さん which is an honorific to elevate people and be polite. This is basically the formal way of saying older brother (versus plain old 兄). It can also be used to refer to a guy that you don't know who has a youthful appearance. \n The reading for this one is pretty tricky, and I'd consider it an exception. To remember it, you have to learn the 兄 part, and everything else will fall into place. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYour (kind) older brother pushes you down on the ground. You stand up and look at your knee (にい), which is all bloody. "Why'd you do that to my knee!?" you ask. "You're supposed to be a nice older brother, that's why I call you お兄さん!"
628 | 一斤 | いっきん | One Loaf of Bread | One Loaf | One bread loaf counter is counting one loaf of bread. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Be careful of the shortening though!

631 | 紙 | かみ | Paper |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading, but lucky for you that's the reading you learned with the kanji, meaning you should be able to read this vocab too.
632 | 時代 | じだい | Period | Epoch\n Era\n Time Period | You have a period of time and it's called a period or era! Simple! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

If you add on に, this changes the word to an adverb, and we get really or truly. 本当に! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It shares the reading with the level 5 本当 as well, but just has a particle on the end. Really!
636 | 理由 | りゆう | Reason | Motive\n Excuse | A reason reason is a reason! How could it not be? Do you have a reason why it shouldn't be? I thought not.\nThis word means "reason" as in the reason you're studying Japanese, or the reason you're late. That's why it can also mean similar words like motive and excuse. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
637 | 〜号室 | ごうしつ | Room Number | Suffix For Room Numbers | This is a counter that can be used after numbers to let you know what number room it is. It's a room number that you use in apartments and hotels to know exactly which room you're looking for. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji.

638 | 失礼 | しつれい | Rude | Rudeness\n Impoliteness\n Excuse Me | When you do something that's your fault and then you say "thanks" after you do it, that's super-duper rude, wouldn't you say? Imagine doing something like this and then thinking to yourself after... wow, I was really rude.\nThis is also often used to mean excuse me, typically followed by ですが or します. Occasionally, it’s also used just on its own, usually when the speaker holds a higher or equal status to the person being spoken to. This particular usage is more prevalent among older generations and is commonly associated with masculine speech. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

640 | 学校 | がっこう | School |  | A study school is obviously a place where people study and learn. In English, that's simply a school. \n This jukugo word consists of on'yomi readings, except 学 (がく) is shortened with a small っ to make it がっこう.
641 | 形 | かたち | Shape | Appearance\n Form | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou really want to eat food that's in neat shapes, so you decide to use a cutter (かた) on your cheese (ち) to make it a new shape. Square cheese is so boring. After you cut it up you have mouse shaped cheese! It just tastes better like that.

644 | 社会 | しゃかい | Society |  | Not to be confused with 会社, which is a company, this is society.

That is a society. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
645 | 強力 | きょうりょく | Strong | Strength\n Powerful | You have strong power. You are strong and powerful. Feel your strength. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 力 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nNothing is as strong and powerful as the きょうと lock (きょうりょく). It's a legendary lock produced in ancient きょうと, rumored to be the strongest lock in existence. What magical powers do you think lie behind the strength of the きょうと lock?
646 | 強い | つよい | Strong |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of strong? It's also strong. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nSo you wanna be strong huh? Well, all you have to do is eat these two yogurts (つよ). One is filled with horse steroids, the other is full of bull steroids. They will make you so strong.
647 | 夏 | なつ | Summer |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading you learned with the kanji is the same as the reading for the vocab.
648 | 夏休み | なつやすみ | Summer Vacation | Summer Break\n Summer Holiday | You know that 夏 means summer and 休 means rest. What is a "summer rest" though? It's a summer break or summer vacation. \n The readings are kun'yomi readings because this word is essentially two separate words put together into one word. You should know the reading for 夏 from the kanji and the reading for 休み from the vocab.
649 | 必ず | かならず | Surely | Certainly\n Without Exception\n Always\n Definitely | This word looks like a verb but it's not (sorry!). It's an adverb. The kanji itself means certain and the vocab version means all sorts of variations on that: surely, certainly, and without exception to name a few. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nRa, the Egyptian god asks you: "Can you do it? Are you certain you can build the pyramids?"\n"Yes I can ra (かなら). Yes I can," you reply.
650 | 白鳥 | はくちょう | Swan |  | There are many white birds out there, for sure, but one really stands out if you ask me. That bird is the swan. It's big, it's white, and it's majestic. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
651 | 仕組み | しくみ | System | Structure\n Mechanism | Doing something as a group requires a system. Without some sort of structure, everyone does their own thing, and you would never be able to get stuff done as a group, you know?\n仕組み refers to the concept of a "mechanism" or "system." It includes the underlying structure, organization, or framework that governs how something works or operates, highlighting its logic, order, and other often unseen things. \n This is a word with an irregular combination of readings. 仕 uses its on'yomi reading, and 組 uses its kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember this unusual combination:\nTo be more successful in doing group assignments, you came up with a system called "sheep cumin (しくみ). Why "sheep cumin"? Sheep are known to be good team players (or herd players, should I say?), so you just sticked it to the name of the group you lead, the cumin group, hoping everyone can work together better, like sheep!
652 | 高い | たかい | Tall | High\n Expensive | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of tall or expensive? It's the same: tall or expensive.\nWeird that this word means both of these things, yeah? Just imagine money piled up to be really tall. That money is tall because it needs to buy something expensive. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nBeing tall is really expensive because you have to buy a tall car (たか). If it's not a tall car then your tall body won't fit inside, and those tall cars are expensive!
653 | その | その | That | Those | Remember how それ means "that one"? その has a very similar meaning: that. It's used before a noun that's either close to the person you're talking to, or fairly close to both of you. For example, その本 is "that book", and the book in question might be in the hand of the person you're talking to, or it might be on a shelf not far from you both.
654 | あの | あの | That Over There | Those Over There | Remember how あれ means "that one over there"? Well, あの means that, and goes before a noun to point out something that is far away from both you and the person you're talking to, such as あの本 (that book over there) or あの子犬 (that puppy over there).\nNotice how these words starting with あ are far away from you? We'll be learning a few more of these, and they all follow the same pattern! What's more, you’ll notice that words ending in の tend to go before a noun.
655 | 末 | すえ | The End | End | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Throw a "the" in there if you'd like, as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou've reached the end of the universe. Nothing is there. You step out, and you're surprised because you get greeted by an old Canadian man. Sue, eh?(すえ) he asks you, over and over. The poor man is looking for his wife Sue, and he's searched to the end of the universe. That's true love. As he walks off into the distance, you hear him calling out, "Sue, eh? Sue, eh? Sue, eh?"
656 | 一体 | いったい | The Heck | In The World\n On Earth | Okay, so this one is really weird, sorry. Each of us only get one body in our lifetimes, right? Well what the heck! What if I want more than one body. Let's all be mad about this together. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Just watch out because いち is shortened to いっ here!
657 | 国民 | こくみん | The People | Citizens\n National | The country peoples are the people of your country. They are the people. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
658 | 今週 | こんしゅう | This Week |  | The now week is this week. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
659 | 考え | かんがえ | Thought | A Thought | This is a noun version of think. What is "a think"? It's a thought. \n You learned this reading with 考える, just cut off the る!
660 | 千円札 | せんえんさつ | Thousand Yen Bill | Thousand Yen Note | You know what 千円 is (1000 yen). So if you add a bill to that you get a thousand yen bill. That's just the little rectangular piece of money that is worth 1000 yen. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
661 | 時 | とき | Time | Hour | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nWhat time is it? It's time to key (とき) your enemy's car. Imagine yourself looking at your watch, waiting until the correct time to perform a synchronized keying of someone's car. Who do you hate the most? Whose car would you like to key?
662 | 付ける | つける | To Attach Something | To Attach | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means attach so the verb version is to attach something. \n The reading is actually the same as the one you learned with the kanji, meaning you should be able to read this one just fine.
663 | 直る | なおる | To Be Fixed | To Fix | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means fix so the verb version is similar to that, to be fixed. This word is for when something is fixed, but you're not the one fixing it. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to learn the なお part. Think of it this way. Something needs to be fixed. It's urgent! It has to be fixed now! (なお). This will also work with the similar word, 直す, which you'll learn soon if you haven't already.
664 | 見当たる | みあたる | To Be Found | To Be Spotted | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\n見当たる is made up of the kanji for  see and right, so what happens when you see the right thing? It was able to be found!\nThis word is generally used in the negative form (見当たらない). You can use it as a roundabout expression for when you can’t find what you’re looking for. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own.
665 | 切り取る | きりとる | To Cut Off | To Cut Out\n To Clip | If you cut and take something, you are going to cut it right off. So, this verb is to cut off. \n The readings come from 切る and 取る. So, know those words separately and you can combine them into this word.
666 | 失う | うしなう | To Lose | To Part With\n To Lose Something\n To Part With Something | The kanji portion means fault, so you would think the verb version is "to fault." It's a little different, though. Think of it this way, if you "fault" something, you're messing up. What's a great way to mess up? By losing something. That's why this word means to lose.\nPretend like you are supposed to hold on to someone's wedding ring. You make the biggest fault of all. You lose it. Ouch. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nSo how did you lose the wedding ring anyway? Well... it was eaten by a cow. The 牛 now (うし + なう) has to have it surgically removed. What a mess!
667 | 取り出す | とりだす | To Pick Out | To Take Out | To take something and then remove it, is when you reach in and grab something and choose it and pull it out.

668 | 代わる | かわる | To Replace | To Substitute For\n To Be Substituted | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means substitute, so we can get to the meaning of this word through that: To replace / to substitute for.\n代わる is used when one thing takes the place of another or assumes the function of something else, like a player being substituted in a game or someone taking over someone else's job. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the か portion.\nYou have to replace your car (か). It is getting old, and seems like it will explode at any moment, literally.
669 | 分ける | わける | To Separate Something | To Divide Something\n To Share\n To Classify | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う (in this case る) sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means part. When you're parting something, you're essentially separating something from others. So, this means to separate something or to divide something. Depending on the context, it can also mean to share or to classify.\nBe careful not to confuse it with 分かる, a similar word with a different meaning. To do so, you'll need to learn the reading. Think of it this way: You "separate" what you care (ける) about from everything else. You want to separate those special things you care about from all the other things you don't care about. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou are to separate a couple of children that really have fun together. When you separate them, they begin to cry and scream: WAAAAAAAAAHHHH (わ). Poor kids.
670 | 光る | ひかる | To Shine | To Glitter | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means sunlight, so the verb is to shine or to glitter. Just imagine what happens when sunlight hits things! \n Remember how you learned the reading for 光? Well this is almost the same thing. Just change the り to る and you'll know this reading!
671 | 教える | おしえる | To Teach | To Tell | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means teach so the verb vocab version means to teach. It's also used to mean to tell in a more general sense. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThink about your favorite teacher. Now think about them teaching you the following: "Today I'm going to teach you about the ocean (おし)." It is big. Really big. Inside it are krakens, space aliens, and lost cities.\nHere is where you continue the lesson in your head, making it the most ridiculous lesson about the ocean you've ever heard. Focus in on the ocean part, since that's the reading, always coming back to it.
672 | 町民 | ちょうみん | Townspeople | Townsperson\n Townsfolk | Town peoples are the townspeople! This can also be singular, so a townsperson. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
673 | 交通 | こうつう | Traffic | Transport\n Transit | Even though it gets mixed up as it passes through itself, modern traffic and transport systems are pretty amazing. This word refers to traffic and transport for pedestrians, bikes, cars, buses, trains, planes... anything that gets us from A to B. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
674 | 三角形 | さんかくけい | Triangle |  | You already learned that 三角 means "triangle." Well this means triangle too, but it's the mathematical term. You should use it in math class. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
675 | 二斤 | にきん | Two Loaves of Bread | Two Loaves | Two bread loaf counters are counting two loaves of bread. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

677 | 台風 | たいふう | Typhoon | Hurricane | A machine that pumps wind can malfunction and make too much, causing a typhoon. It's a really powerful machine to be able to move that much wind. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. Instead of だい for 台 though, this uses the reading たい. Remember it like this:\nWhen a typhoon is coming you have to tie (たい) down all of your stuff. Or, you know, if you already know the word typhoon, that's fine too.
678 | 大学生 | だいがくせい | University Student | College Student\n Uni Student | You know that 学生 means "student" and you know that 大学 means university/college.

680 | 言い方 | いいかた | Way Of Saying | Way Of Talking\n Speaking Style | The way of saying something is your way of saying. This could be your accent or simply the way you talk. \n This uses the kun'yomi readings from the vocab words 言う and 方. So as long as you're okay with those, you can apply that knowledge over here.
681 | 考え方 | かんがえかた | Way Of Thinking | Thought Process | The think way is really the way someone thinks. That's why this word means way of thinking. \n This uses the kun'yomi readings from the vocab words 考える and 方. So as long as you're okay with those, you can apply that knowledge over here.
682 | 弱い | よわい | Weak |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of weak? It's also weak. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou just got beaten up because you're weak. Then the bully asks you: "Yo! Why (よわ) you so weak?"
683 | 弱点 | じゃくてん | Weak Point | Weakness | The weak point is your weak point. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

686 | 風 | かぜ | Wind |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Do you know the word "kamikaze" from WWII history? Well, it means "divine wind." The "kaze" part is the wind part, and this word uses the same reading, making it かぜ as well.
687 | 年末 | ねんまつ | Year End | End Of The Year\n End Of Year | The year end is the year end aka the end of the year. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
688 | 黄色 | きいろ | Yellow | Yellow Color\n Color Yellow | The yellow color is just the color yellow. \n The readings are the same as the readings you learned with the kanji meaning you should be able to read this word right off the bat.
689 | 地上 | ちじょう | Above Ground | On The Ground\n The Earth's Surface | Remember 地下, which is "below ground." Well, this is ground and above combined together, so I bet you can guess that this means above ground. But usually things above ground don't float (unless you're in space), so it's really on the ground. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
690 | 住所 | じゅうしょ | Address |  | If you dwell in a place, that place is your address. \n This word is made up of the on'yomi readings that you've already learned with the kanji. Have at it!
691 | 助言 | じょげん | Advice |  | When you help with what you say, you're giving advice.\nThis word is commonly found in formal or professional contexts. In more casual settings, you can just use アドバイス (advise) instead. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
692 | 全米 | ぜんべい | All America |  | Do you remember how 米国 can mean "America?" That 米 means America sometimes. So, when you see all rice (I mean, America), you can think of this word as meaning All America (sort of like how 全日本 means "All Japan."). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
693 | 思い出 | おもいで | A Memory | Memories\n Memory | Do you remember the word 思う? It means "to think." What you are thinking is exiting—it's coming out of your head! You're recalling a memory or multiple memories. \n The readings are both kun'yomi, but based off of previous experience with the two separate words that make up this word, you should be able to read it. Just remember that it's kun'yomi. One hint is the hiragana sticking out of the 思.
694 | 〜間 | かん | Amount Of Time | Interval Of Time\n Time Interval\n Period Of Time | When you stick this onto the end of another word that talks about an interval of time in some way, you're indicating the amount of time that has gone past. For example, 二年間 is "two years." 一時間 is "one hour." Any amount of time + 〜間 will make it an "amount of time" instead of just a specific time.\nNote that 〜間 can be omitted, especially in conversations, when it's clear that you're talking about a duration of time from the context. However, the exception is 時. You always say 〜時間 to refer to the amount of hours, to differentiate from 〜時 (〜o'clock). \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. This should save you at least 二分間.
695 | 他所 | よそ | Another Place | Somewhere Else\n Other Place\n Elsewhere | When you're talking about some other place you're talking about another place. \n This is a jukugo word, which you would normally expect to use the on'yomi readings from the kanji. With this word, however, the on'yomi readings are rarely used now, so they sound rather out of date. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember the more common reading in contemporary Japanese:\nAnother place you saw (よそ) always seems better. In other words, the grass is greener somewhere else you saw!
696 | 答え | こたえ | Answer | Reply\n Response | You can guess this is a noun version of the kanji because the hiragana sticking out of it isn't an う-related sound or an い-related sound. So, what is the noun version of answer? It's also answer. \n The reading is kun'yomi, but this is also the reading you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this and then give your 答え correctly.
697 | 辺り | あたり | Area | Vicinity\n Neighborhood | This is the noun version of the kanji for area. This makes it have the same meaning as the kanji: area, vicinity, or neighborhood. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nIf you think about an area that you're in, it's the place you're at (あた).
698 | 作者 | さくしゃ | Author | Writer | Someone who makes is someone who creates things. Back in the day, a creator like this may have been known as many things, but the big one that stands out is an author.\nWondering about the difference between 作者 and 作家? Basically, 作者 just refers to the creator of a particular creative work, such as a book, article, artwork, piece of music, etc., while 作家 refers to someone who creates those things as an occupation. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 作 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nYour favorite author is also a sack shaman (さくしゃ). They do all sorts of weird magic involving sacks, and you just love reading about it. Maybe one day, you can become a sack shaman and writer yourself.
699 | 電池 | でんち | Battery |  | A pond for electricity? May seem weird at first, but if you think of something that's gathering all the electricity into one pond... that thing is like a battery (and is a battery). \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
700 | 身 | み | Body | Oneself\n Animal Flesh | The kanji is somebody, but the word is body. I guess somebody is somebody's body, so they are similar at least. It also refers to animal flesh sometimes, meaning the non-bone edible parts of animals, including seafood. It's the "mi" in sashimi!\nWonder about the difference between 体 and 身? 体 refers to physical human and animal bodies, often describing their condition, appearance, etc. While 身 can also mean "physical human body," it can also refer to the self as an individual and be used to indicate one’s social standing or position. That's why you might see 身 used in idiomatic phrases like 身につく, which refers to acquiring or mastering something, like a skill. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Who is that somebody? Who is that body? Why, of course it is me (み).
701 | 心身 | しんしん | Body And Mind | Mind And Body | Technically this kanji is heart and somebody, but think about it this way. Where does everything come from inside somebody? The heart! It keeps things going by pumping blood, providing the foundation for both a good mind and body. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
702 | 両者 | りょうしゃ | Both People |  | When you have both someones, you have both people. You'll notice over time that 者 is often used to indicate a person or type of person, so keep that in mind for future words as well! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
703 | 〜君 | くん | Boy Name Ender | Male Name Ender\n Kun | Add this to the end of someone's name, it's like saying ______buddy. It's generally used as a name ender (like さん) for boys and young men. Don't use this on people who are higher ranked than you (socially or literally). As in, you wouldn't use it on your boss. Use it on your younger male subordinates as well as boys who aren't adults yet. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji (on'yomi), probably because it usually is attached to other words (aka names, like こういち君) making it act more like jukugo words do.
704 | 支局 | しきょく | Branch Office |  | The support bureau is the group that supports a business. It is the branch office.\nIf it helps, this word has the same meaning as 支店 which you will also be learning in this level. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
705 | 支店 | してん | Branch Office | Branch Store | The support shop is the branch office. Presumably this is because the regular "shop" is the "shop" and anything that supports it is the local (branch) office.\nIf it helps, this word has the same meaning as 支局 which you will also be learning in this level. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
706 | 朝ごはん | あさごはん | Breakfast |  | ごはん is a food or meal (maybe you'll learn the kanji for it later, but it's not usually used, so you're learning it this way now). What is your morning meal? That is breakfast (not to be confused with second breakfast, you hobbit). \n The reading for 朝 is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, meaning you should be able to read everything here.
707 | 局 | きょく | Bureau | Department\n Station\n Office | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The kanji and the vocab are exactly the same, even the reading. This one uses the on'yomi probably because it's often attached to other words (specifying a bureau, for example), so that's why it follows jukugo conventions despite being all alone.
708 | でも | でも | But | However | I want to show you my demo (でも), but you don't want to see it. However, I'm going to show it to you anyway. So there.\nSomething to watch out for with でも is that it always goes at the beginning of a sentence, not in the middle, like "but" usually does in English. It’s also a fairly casual word, so it’s not normally used in formal situations.
709 | 雲 | くも | Cloud |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This word uses the kun'yomi reading because it's a single kanji on its own. Luckily, that's the reading you learned with the kanji already, so you should be able to read this.
710 | 楽 | らく | Comfort | Ease\n Pleasure | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the kanji you learned, too, making this one an ease to learn!
711 | 全く | まったく | Completely | Entirely\n Truly\n Really\n Wholly | This is the adverb version of the kanji all. So, it's like you add an 'ly' to it. But, that doesn't work too well (allly? c'mon). So, instead think of this word as completely, entirely or truly. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThe person who completely doesn't understand this vocab word is Matt (まった). Be sure to take note of the small っ, too.
712 | 対立 | たいりつ | Confrontation | Opposition | When you stand up versus someone, you're looking to get into a confrontation. Just imagine yourself doing this to someone bigger than you. You stand up to versus them and then realize this confrontation is a bad idea. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
713 | 会話 | かいわ | Conversation | Dialogue | When you meet and talk with someone else, you're having a conversation. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
714 | 決 | けつ | Decision |  | Noun version of decide? It's a decision. \n The reading for this word is the same as the kanji!
715 | 決心 | けっしん | Determination | Resolution\n Conviction | When you decide with your heart you have true determination, unlike when you decide with your mind. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just make sure you take note of the shortened つ. So, けつ goes to けっ.
716 | 医者 | いしゃ | Doctor | Physician | Someone who works in medicine is a doctor. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
717 | 役目 | やくめ | Duty | Business\n Role | If you have an eye for service, then you always think helping people is your duty! If you see it, then you offer your service. It's the right thing to do! \n This word consists of the on'yomi reading for 役 and the kun'yomi reading for 目. You've learned them both so you should be able to read this word too!
718 | 東口 | ひがしぐち | East Exit | East Entrance\n East Gate | Remember how 入り口 means entrance and 出口 means exit? This is just the 口 part with a direction on it. That means it can be both entrance or exit. So when you have East up there this word can mean both East exit and East entrance. This is a great word to know if you need to know which side of a train station you need to leave on to go somewhere or meet someone! \n This word uses kun'yomi readings, possibly because of 口, which is a body part (body parts do that quite a bit in words and kanji). You should hopefully have seen both the kun'yomi readings from previous levels meaning you can read this word as well. Just watch out for the rendaku that changes くち to ぐち.
719 | 電気 | でんき | Electricity | Light | Electricity energy is just a fancy way to say electricity. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
720 | 電力 | でんりょく | Electric Power | Electricity | The electricity power of something is its electric power. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 力 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nAll the world's electric power is stored behind this lock (りょく). Go ahead. Open it up. What could possibly go wrong?
721 | 電子 | でんし | Electron | Electronic | An electricity child. What is a really small part of electricity? What makes up electricity? That would be the electron.

723 | 工学者 | こうがくしゃ | Engineer |  | Do you remember 工学 from a couple levels ago? This is someone who is in 工学. If 工学 is "engineering" then 工学者 is an engineer. \n The readings are just the on'yomi readings of the kanji. All things you should know now.
724 | 入場 | にゅうじょう | Entrance | Admission\n Entering | When you enter a location, that's your entrance.\nThis is a common word for admission into public events or venues, like a concert hall, a sports stadium, or a theme park. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji.

725 | 毎朝 | まいあさ | Every Morning |  | Every morning is every morning! \n The reading is a combination of on'yomi and kun'yomi. That being said, both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this.

728 | 楽しい | たのしい | Fun |  | Ending with an い tells you that this word is an い-adjective. What's the adjective form of pleasure? Well, you could say it's "pleasurable," but I'm afraid that's not what we're going for here. In this case, this word is a little more innocent. It just means fun. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nHow much fun did you have? You just had a ton o' (たの) fun!
729 | もしもし | もしもし | Hello | Telephone Hello\n Excuse Me | Woah, this place is mossy, mossy (もしもし)! This moss needs clearing up, so you call up the person in charge. Hello, says the person on the phone.\nもしもし is a telephone hello, the standard way to answer the phone in Japan!

It's a very nice place, be sure to visit it if you can for some of the freshest seafood around. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. The ほく does get shortened though, so be careful!
732 | 馬 | うま | Horse |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nImagine someone riding a horse. Who is that person? It's Uma (うま) Thurman, the famous actress.
733 | 馬力 | ばりき | Horsepower |  | This word was probably made pretty recently. A horse's power? That is horsepower. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 力 has two common on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nCars with high horsepower are usually driven by Ricky (りき). Ricky is well-known for loving all cars with a lot of horsepower, so he's often seen driving around in fancy sports cars. Vroom vroom Ricky!
734 | 人間 | にんげん | Human | Human Being | The person interval. Just think of different intervals each with a different type of species. The raccoon interval... the dog interval... the person interval... they are the humans. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, and the reading of 間 is a bit of an oddball, here's a mnemonic to help you:\nDid you know that the humans who work for Nintendo are all called Genji (にんげん)? Yep, that's right, every single human ever hired by Nintendo is called Genji, without exception.
735 | 大役 | たいやく | Important Task | Great Duty\n Important Role | A big duty is a great duty. It can also be an important task. Think about some kind of big duty you have. Then, think about what an important task it is too. Feel proud of your important task. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nYou've been assigned the important task of taking care of the local tie yaks (たいやく). Where you're from, tie-wearing yaks are incredibly important, so don't take this great duty lightly!
736 | 間 | あいだ | Interval | Interval Of Time\n Time Interval\n Between\n Room | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nDon't confuse this with 〜間 which is similar in meaning but different in reading. The 〜間 means it's attached to something. This is a standalone word. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. 間 has two common kun'yomi readings, あいだ and ま. You haven't learned these readings yet, so here's an explanation of each reading and mnemonics to help you remember them:\nWhen 間 refers to a longer interval of time, it's generally read as あいだ. For a short burst of time, it's read as ま. When it means an interval of space, it's usually read as あいだ.\nYou can remember this because time feels longer in Idaho (あいだ). Any interval of time you spend there feels so long, because Idaho life moves so slowly. As soon as you cross the border and enter a new state, you call your ma (ま) to tell her you're finally out of that slooooow state, and the intervals of time feel shorter.
737 | 研究 | けんきゅう | Research | Investigation\n Study | When you sharpen research you're just doing a study or investigation. Or in other words, you're doing research! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
738 | 究明 | きゅうめい | Investigation |  | Research is the process of brightening a subject area, akin to conducting an investigation that illuminates the unknown.\nThis is a word often found in academic and scientific contexts, encompassing the act of conducting a thorough investigation or ascertaining facts. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
739 | 前回 | ぜんかい | Last Time | Previous Time | The before time was last time or the previous time \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
740 | 長さ | ながさ | Length |  | You know the word 長い from a couple levels ago. This is like the word 大きい versus 大きさ, where 大きさ is "size" and 大きい is "big." So, 長い is "long" and 長さ is length. \n If you know the reading of the word 長い from level 6 you'll know the reading for this word too. Only difference is the さ at the end, which is hiragana so it should be easy to read.
741 | 生地 | きじ | Material | Cloth\n Fabric\n Dough\n Batter | Life that comes out of the earth is made up of different kinds of materials. Sometimes it's cloth, sometimes it's dough, but everything has to be made out of something. \n This word uses a new kun'yomi reading for 生 and a new on'yomi reading for 地. You haven't learned either of these readings yet, sorry! Here's some mnemonics to help you:\nIf you want the best material to make clothes or pies out of, the key (き)is asking Jesus (じ)! He knows everything, including where to find the materials for whatever weird thing you're making. Just remember: Who's the key? Jesus!
742 | 数学 | すうがく | Mathematics | Math\n Maths | The study of numbers is mathematics (or math). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
743 | 医学 | いがく | Medical Science | Medicine | The study of medicine is medical science. It can also be called medicine, but make sure to think of it as the "medicine" where it has to do with "medical science." \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
744 | 医大 | いだい | Medical University | Medical School\n Med School | You've seen 大学 to mean "college." So take the 大 and put it with medicine to create "medicine college", or medical university. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nYour local medical university really prides itself on its eagle dye (いだい). It's the only dye in the world made straight out of eagles. A bit strange for a medical university, but impressive nonetheless!
745 | 地中海 | ちちゅうかい | Mediterranean Sea |  | Earth's middle sea is the Mediterranean Sea. It may not look like it's in the middle of the earth, but a long time ago that's what people thought. It's the sea between Southern Europe and Northern Africa. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
746 | 〜道 | どう | Method Of | Way\n Style\n Way Of | This is a word that's attached to the end of various other words. Think of a "road" as a way or method of something. For example, the どう in Judo is the soft "way." There are many words that end with 道, and you'll see them later on. For now, know that this means method of or way. \n This word is added to the end of many different words, meaning it's treated like most jukugo (and uses an on'yomi reading). You know the on'yomi reading, so you should be able to read this word. Be sure to drop the 〜 when writing in the reading in the test, though. It's only there to show that it's added onto things and not part of the correct answer.
747 | 君主国 | くんしゅこく | Monarchy |  | One ruler is the master of this entire country. Why, this sounds quite like a monarchy to me. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
748 | 朝 | あさ | Morning |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Hopefully this means you won't have to wake up too early in the morning to study kanji, now.
749 | 朝日 | あさひ | Morning Sun | Rising Sun | The morning sun is not only the morning sun, but it's the rising sun as well (because that's when the sun rises, right?). \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, which is convenient since you've learned both of them by now with the words 朝 (あさ) and 日 (ひ). Put them together and what do you get? あさひ!
750 | 音楽 | おんがく | Music |  | What is the sound of pleasure? What sound puts you at ease? For most people that is some nice music. Just be sure you don't put on any Bieber... that would be like 不音楽 or something... I kid, I kid. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 楽 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nIf you play your music too loud, people will come and gawk (がく) at you. But if you try to turn it off and say, "OH I DON'T LIKE MUSIC ANYWAY!" they'll gawk at you even more. Learn proper music etiquette and people won't gawk at you so much, okay?
751 | 名前 | なまえ | Name | First Name\n Full Name\n Given Name | Your name that's in the front. That is not your last name, that is your regular name or your first name. \n This word uses both kun'yomi readings (oh darn!). That being said, you've seen the kun'yomi readings for both the kanji that make up this word. The word 名 (な) and the word 前 (まえ) both are kun'yomi, so use those words and Voltron them into a single word, なまえ.
752 | 当たり前 | あたりまえ | Natural | Reasonable\n Obvious\n Usual\n Common | You've seen how 当たり means success. If you've experienced success before, everything after that seems to be pretty obvious. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own.
753 | 次回 | じかい | Next Time |  | The next time you look at this kanji, you should know that it means next time. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
754 | お知らせ | おしらせ | Notice | Notification\n Flier | This is a strange word, so you'll have to bear with me. You know that 知 means know. But in the case of this word, what do you know? Look at the second half. らせ sounds a bit like "race." So, you know about a "race." How do you know about this race? You got a notice or notification about it. \n Remember 知る? This is the same reading (し). So, if you know that, you'll be able to read this one as well.
755 | 数 | かず | Number | Count\n Amount | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nThis word is used to say things like "a high number" and "the number of students". \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nImagine yourself counting by playing a kazoo (かず). Each number you count, you toot your kazoo. How fun!
756 | 番号 | ばんごう | Number | Series Of Digits | A number in a series plus a number. You know what happens when two kanji with basically the same meaning get combined into one by now, right? It just turns out to be the same meaning, basically. This word means number, and it's used in contexts like phone numbers, exam numbers, and serial numbers. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
757 | 一番 | いちばん | Number One | The First\n First\n The Best\n Best\n The Most\n Most | When you're the number one in a number in a series, you're number one ba-bay! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
758 | 二番 | にばん | Number Two | Second | When you're number two in a number in a series you're number two. Not quite as good as being 一番, but take what you can get, you know? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
759 | 数字 | すうじ | Numeral | Digit\n Number | A number letter isn't a letter like the ones you're reading now, it's more like a numeral, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
760 | 反対 | はんたい | Opposition | Opposite | The anti versus... You'd think this would be a double negative, but it's like a lot of other words where you have two similar words combined... it just means the same thing as those two words. In this case, the anti-versus of something would be the opposite. Alternatively, it can be the opposition. You choose. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
761 | 向こう | むこう | Over There | Opposite Side\n Other Side\n Far Away | You know that 向 means yonder. So, think of a "yonder こういち." All you know is that he's over there on the other side / opposite side of where you are. Basically, he's just pretty far away, wherever he is. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nStanding with こういち is a cow. It is saying moo (む). Weird, now こういち is saying it too. Also, if you know the reading of 向く you should be able to read this one as well.
762 | 未決 | みけつ | Pending | Unsettled\n Undecided\n Not Yet Decided | Something that is not yet decided... it is pending... it is unsettled. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
763 | 私自身 | わたしじしん | Personally | As For Me\n Myself | "When it comes to somebody like myself... aka I..." When you say this you're really saying "personally" or "as for me." \n The readings are a bit weird here. The 私 is わたし and the rest is on'yomi kanji readings. So, it's a mix of both, I'm afraid. "When it comes to me, I like mixing up on'yomi and kun'yomi because I hate myself."
764 | 絵 | え | Picture | Painting\n Drawing\n Illustration | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n絵 refers to pictures, such as paintings, drawings, or illustrations. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
765 | 投手 | とうしゅ | Pitcher |  | You already know that 手 means "hand," but it can also mean "doer," as in someone who performs a particular action or task. Why? Because we use our hands to do things. And when it comes to throwing, the doer is the pitcher! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 手 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nTo be a good pitcher, all you have to do is put the ball into the chute (しゅ). Pitchers don't actually throw the ball. There is an invisible pitching chute right on the mound. You slide the ball into the chute and off it goes!
766 | 所 | ところ | Place | Spot\n Scene | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nWondering about how 所 differs from 場所? While 場所 only refers to a physical location, 所 can also refer to an abstract place, such as a point in time, a situation, or a condition. Hence, 所 usually needs some context to clarify what kind of place you are talking about. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nHere's the place! Either you have to talk or row (ところ). If you talk, maybe you can talk your way out of this problem you're in. If you row, you may be able to escape. Either way, this is the place for it.
767 | 場所 | ばしょ | Place | Location\n Spot | A location place is either a place or a location, just like the kanji it's made from. \n This word uses the kun'yomi reading for the first kanji and the on'yomi reading for the second. You haven't learned this reading for 場 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhat is this place you're in? You look around and listen. You hear, "Baa (ば) baa baa!" You must be in a barn!
768 | 点数 | てんすう | Points | Score | The number of points is how many points there are (aka the score). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
769 | 交番 | こうばん | Police Box | Koban | This word is a little tricky — at first, the combination of mix and number in a series doesn't seem to add up to police box, but there's a catch. This word is actually an abbreviated combo of two other words: The 交 comes from 交替 (in rotation) and the 番 comes from 立番 (standing watch).\nA police box is basically a tiny community police station staffed by one or two officers. It's something that is not common in many Western countries, but it is pretty much all over Japan. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
770 | 池 | いけ | Pond |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n If you fall into a pond, what sound do you make? EEEEK (いけ)! Or maybe you're just afraid of ponds (I don't blame you, there are probably snakes or leeches or alligators in there) and you EEEEK when someone mentions them.
771 | 私立大学 | しりつだいがく | Private College | Private University | You've seen 私立, which is "private," and you've seen 大学, which is "college" or "university." So, combine them together and you have a private college / private university. \n If you know the readings of the words 私立 and 大学 you'll be able to read this. It's also all jukugo on'yomi readings too, so you can read it that way.
772 | 番組 | ばんぐみ | Program | Programme | Use a number in a series to group the things you watch and listen to. That makes them your programs. Your TV and radio programs, specifically. If you watch TV you'll hear it a lot! \n This word consists of the on'yomi reading for 番 and the kun'yomi reading for 組. You've learned them both so as long as you remember the rendaku, you should be able to read this word too!
773 | 役人 | やくにん | Public Official | Government Official\n Public Servant | A person with duty is someone who works for the government... a government official or public official. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nA public official recently declared that all the yaks at Nintendo (やくにん) are going to be kicked out. You didn't know that Nintendo has resident yaks? Well it does, but not for much longer. But who will take care of all the Nintendo yaks now?! Maybe you could take one in!
774 | 住人 | じゅうにん | Resident | Inhabitant\n Dweller | If you dwell somewhere and you’re a person, that makes you a resident. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nAll the residents in my area care about is jewels and Nintendo (じゅうにん). Their houses are crammed full of jewels and Nintendo stuff. How about the residents of your town? I bet they all love jewels and Nintendo too.
775 | 道 | みち | Road | Street\n Path\n Way | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nDon't confuse this with the word 〜道, though. This one doesn't have a 〜 at the beginning, meaning it's not attached to other words. This word is just plain old road. It has its own meaning! \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou're walking down the road. On the road, you bump into your friend, Mitch (みち). Imagine saying hello, then continuing down the road. What's weird is you're both walking down a paved road with cars on it. Seems dangerous, but you and Mitch, you know what you're doing.\nIf you don't know anyone named Mitch, think of a famous Mitch or a Mitch you've made up.
776 | 役 | やく | Role | Part\n Duty\n Service | If you have a certain duty then it's your job to play that role. You have to play the part. Like in a play! \n The reading is the same as the kanji you learned, meaning you should be able to read this one as well.
777 | 円い | まるい | Round | Circular | This word is made up of a single kanji with hiragana attached to it. That hiragana ends with い which means it's an adjective. So, what's the adjective form of the kanji that's in this word? 円 means both "yen" and "round" but in this case we're looking at the round one (because something isn't going to be "yenny"). The adjective version of round is round or circular. Just like a yen coin, this "round" is a flat round. As in, if you draw a circle on a piece of paper, you could use this word. Same goes with yen, which is why "yen" and "round" both use the same kanji. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThe reading for the 円 portion of this word is the same as a kanji you learned on level 2: 丸. That kanji means something really similar to this kanji. And guess what? They also share a reading. So, if you know that the reading of 丸 is まる then you'll also know that the reading for this word is まる!
778 | 学者 | がくしゃ | Scholar |  | Someone who does study for a living. That is a scholar. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
779 | 数年 | すうねん | Several Years |  | When a number of years have passed you say that several years have passed! You don't want to say how many years, so just say several years. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
780 | 歩道 | ほどう | Sidewalk | Footpath\n Pavement | The road you walk on is the sidewalk... at least I hope that's where you walk. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
781 | おやつ | おやつ | Snack |  | Oh yah! Two (おやつ) snacks, just for you. Imagine your two snacks. What are they? I bet they're delicious. Oh yah!\nおやつ can be anything from candy to cookies to onigiri. Basically, it's anything fairly light that’s eaten between meals.
782 | 間もなく | まもなく | Soon | Before Long\n Shortly | The もなく part is like saying "there isn't even." So, when "there isn't even an interval of time," things will happen soon or before long.\nYou'll probably hear this the most in train announcements letting you know your train will shortly be arriving in Tokyo or wherever. \n The reading for this one is weird, though. It's a second kun'yomi reading (there is also あいだ), read as ま. So what is happening soon? Your Ma is going to be here before long. You better hurry and prepare, because your room looks terrible...\n"間もなく, your mom is about to show up!"
783 | 南米 | なんべい | South America |  | Remember how 米国 can also mean America? That goes for North and South America, actually, not just the United States. So, south America is South America. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
784 | 南口 | みなみぐち | South Exit | South Entrance\n Southern Exit\n Southern Entrance\n South Gate | The South mouth isn't actually a mouth you find in the south pole or anything, it's an entrance or exit. This is kind of like how 入り口 means entrance (the 口 represents a doorway). You'll see this word a lot in places like train stations or airports. It means both South exit and South entrance. \n The reading for these kanji are both kun'yomi. Probably because it's two words put together (South + Exit) rather than a single word. Also, body parts tend to change words into kun'yomi readings as well. So, you've seen vocab words that give you the kun'yomi reading of both 南 and 口, right? Now you just need to combine the two vocab readings into one to be able to read this word. Just watch out for the rendaku that changes くち to ぐち.
785 | 空間 | くうかん | Space |  | The sky interval is an area of the sky. In places that are just empty sky, there is only space. Of course, not technically... there's something there, but back in the day when kanji was being made, nobody knew that. This word can mean both space in regards to outer space as well as the space around you in your room. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
786 | まだ | まだ | Still | Not Yet | You've been getting madder (まだ) and madder, and you’re still mad. You’re not yet as mad as you could be, though.\nYou can use まだ to talk about a situation that started in the past and continues into the present. Wait! Where are you going? I'm still explaining this! I'm not done yet!
787 | 科目 | かもく | Subject | Course\n Curriculum | If you've got an eye on a certain course, it's a subject you really want to take. Maybe you're in school and that means you'll be taking a lot of courses. Maybe you're a teacher and you're planning out your curriculum. Either way, you have your eye on the course-prize. \n The readings are the on'yomi readings, but you learned the kun'yomi reading for 目 before. So, you have to remember that this word uses もく instead of め. To do that, imagine seeing that the subjects you're allowed to take next term are different than everyone else's. The other kids notice, and start mocking (もく) you for it. Think of what those subjects are and how you're being mocked for having to take them.
788 | 代わり | かわり | Substitute | Replacement | You've seen that 代わる means "to substitute for" or "to replace." This is the noun version of that (no う sound on the end). So, what is the noun version of those verb words? It would be substitute or replacement. \n You should be able to figure out the reading from learning 代わる in the previous level.
789 | 自決 | じけつ | Suicide | Self Determination | When you decide with your self, that is your own decision. That comes from you. That comes from your self determination. But the word is mainly used in Japan as a euphemism for suicide. It's kind of important that you know that.\nThis word is very formal and generally used in historical contexts, such as referencing suicides that occurred during wartime. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
790 | 電話 | でんわ | Telephone | Phone | An electricity talk. What is this witchcraft? The only way to talk via electricity is with a telephone. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
791 | 身体 | しんたい | The Body | Health\n Body | Somebody's body. This refers to the very general word the body. As in, "the human body" or something like that. This can also refer to health as well. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.\nThis word can also be read からだ, which is irregular but shouldn't be too hard to remember because it's the same as the reading you already learned for 体! You'd usually use this reading in casual contexts, and when the word is on its own, rather than in a compound word. In formal situations and compounds, you'd want to stick to the regular old on'yomi reading.
792 | 人数 | にんずう | The Number Of People | The Amount Of People | The person count is the number of people. Don't confuse this with the "population" or something like that, though. This is more like "how many people are at this event?" What's the 人数, you know? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Note that rendaku turns すう into ずう, and since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nDo you know the number of people at Nintendo (にん)? It's a big mystery, which is why they hired you to count every single one of them. Good luck!
793 | この前 | このまえ | The Other Day | Recently\n In Front of This | この means "this", and you know what the word 前  means (front/before). The combination of these words, "this before" if you will, can mean a few different things. If we're talking about when something happened, the "before" meaning kicks in, and it means the other day or recently. If we're talking about location, then the "front" meaning kicks in, and it means in front of this. \n The reading for 前 is the kun'yomi, like the reading for the vocabulary word 前. So long as you know that word, you'll be able to read this one too. The reason it's not on'yomi is because it's like two words put together. The word この and the word 前.
794 | 引き分け | ひきわけ | Tie | Draw | When you pull something and "separate"(分ける) it, you are making everything even. In a game, this would be a tie or a draw. \n See the hiragana stuck in there? That's hinting that these use the kun'yomi readings. You learned the kun'yomi readings of these two kanji separately in the previous level, so if you know those you should know this word's reading as well.
795 | 時間 | じかん | Time |  | The time interval of time is just the time. As is often the case, if two similar meaning kanji are combined into one word, they tend to produce a word with a similar meaning. Excuse me, friend, what's the 時間? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
796 | 答える | こたえる | To Answer | To Reply\n To Respond | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means answer so the verb version means to answer. \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading as you'd expect with all the hiragana, but luckily that's the reading you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this.
797 | 出来上がる | できあがる | To Be Finished | To Be Completed | You've seen the word 出来る (to be able to do), which is the first part. Then the second part, 上がる means "to rise." So, think about it this way: once you're able to do something, you rise because you're finished. That's why this verb means to be finished. \n The reading is a combination of the readings from 出来る and 上がる. So long as you were paying attention in lessons past, you should be able to read this word as well just by combining those other words.
798 | 交じる | まじる | To Be Mixed | To Be Blended With\n To Join | You know that 交ぜる means to mix and that the kanji means mix as well. So, this probably has something to do with mixing things. This word means to be mixed. This is when something is mixed but it's not mixed by you. It's just being mixed. Think of it this way - the じ in 交じる is Jesus, who just uses Jesus magic to mix something. So, you're not mixing it. It's just when something is to be mixed. \n The reading is the same as with 交ぜる. So long as you know the ま portion of that word's reading, you'll be able to read this word as well.
799 | 曲げる | まげる | To Bend | To Bend Something | This is a verb because it ends with an う sound. What does the kanji mean? It's music and bend. In the case of this word, we're going with the "bend" version. The verb of that is to bend. This is when you're doing the bending. You can remember this because げ kind of looks like the gecko you're bending. That gecko looked good before you bent him in half. \n How were you able to bend this gecko? Solo effort? No way! It actually took both you and your mama (ま) to make it happen! Just imagine you and your mighty mama, tag-teaming to bend a gecko in half!
800 | 役に立つ | やくにたつ | To Be Useful | To Be Of Use\n To Be Helpful\n To Be Of Service | When you stand up to do your duty you're standing up and finally being useful.

801 | 買う | かう | To Buy |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

It's often used in stories where animals or spirits take on human forms. It can also describe transformations in real life that are so dramatic they feel unreal. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou try to transform. You want to turn into something awesome, like a dinosaur, but then *poof* you turn into a sheep. "Baaaa," you say. "Baaa."
803 | 数える | かぞえる | To Count |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means count, so obviously the verb version is to count. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.

Scientists have to come in, but they can't figure out the cause (かぞ) of your counting. They drag you away to a padded cell where they keep testing you trying to figure out the cause of your craziness.

805 | 見分ける | みわける | To Distinguish | To Tell Apart\n To Recognize | You see something, then you "separate"(分ける) it. This is the same thing as to distinguish, to tell apart, or to recognize. This verb is transitive, so you're doing the action to something. You're distinguishing between things or people. \n You should know the reading of 見 already. The second part, 分ける is a word you should have learned in the previous level. Combine that knowledge together and you get the reading for this word.
806 | 対する | たいする | To Face | To Be Directed Toward\n To Contrast | When you do (する) versus, you choose to face an opponent. It’s where your attention and efforts are going to be directed toward. Alternatively, you can use this word to contrast one thing with another.\nThis word is used to help point out the relationship between two things in a sentence, where one thing is focusing on another thing. This is all a little vague and perhaps confusing, so check out the collocations and context sentences to get a better grasp of this word! \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, so you should be able to read this word no problem.
807 | 近づく | ちかづく | To Get Close | To Approach\n To Draw Near\n To Near\n To Bring Near | Because this word ends with an う sound, you can tell it's probably a verb. The kanji portion means near. The verb version of that is to draw near, to get close or to approach. Essentially, the general idea is that you're getting closer to something. You're becoming more nearby. You're approaching. \n There's hiragana attached to this kanji, which means it's probably the kun'yomi reading (and it is). You've seen the kun'yomi reading via the word 近い. So, as long as you know that word, you should be able to read this one as well.
808 | 当てる | あてる | To Guess | To Hit\n To Put | You know that the kanji 当 means right or success. So since this is a verb, you're doing right and success (which doesn't make much sense). Instead, you're guessing something and getting it right. So, this word means to guess something. Hopefully you don't have to guess too hard when it comes to the meaning of this word as well. \n The reading can be remembered via the word 当たる which you learned a few levels ago. Use that knowledge to remember that this word is read as あてる. The important part is the あ.
809 | 助ける | たすける | To Help | To Save\n To Rescue | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means help so the verb version is to help. Don't confuse this with 助かる which means "to be helped." You know that 助ける is "to help" because you're doing the helping. You know that you're doing the helping because you care (ける). \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou need to help someone. Someone is hanging off a cliff and out of reach. They ask you, the person standing above them, to toss (たす) them a rope, but you refuse. "TOSS IT!" they yell. "I WILL NOT TOSS IT," you respond. You're a jerk.
810 | 住む | すむ | To Live | To Dwell\n To Reside | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means dwell, so the verb version means to live, to reside, or of course to dwell. Basically, someone is living somewhere. Where do you live? \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have a place to live... but not for long. You are being sued (す) out of your house and home so you will have nowhere to dwell.
811 | 明日 | あした | Tomorrow |  | A bright day isn't today (because today was terrible), it's tomorrow, because you can always look to tomorrow to be a better, brighter day. \n The reading makes no sense at all. You have to learn it straight up, and can't rely on the kanji it's made from. Why is tomorrow going to be such a bright and awesome day? Because you're making ash tacos for dinner, and that's your favorite. Imagine imagining tomorrow, full of ash tacos and deliciousness. Maybe you could use some of those Dorito taco shells?\nA note about the other two readings あす and みょうにち: あす is used in the news and in weather reports, and みょうにち is really only used in business, so you should really only be using あした for now. But it's good to know that the other two readings exist!

In order to pass through it, you decide to kick it as hard as you can to knock it down. Unfortunately, it is way stronger than you, and your toe explodes on contact. You yell: "TOE! OH!" (とお) and then just scream a lot.
813 | 見直す | みなおす | To Reevaluate | To Look Again\n To Reassess | You know the word 直す from a couple levels ago. It means "to fix." So, when you fix what you see, what are you doing? You're reevaluating something. That's why this word means to reevaluate. \n The readings are all kun'yomi readings, like the vocab you've seen already. This is like two vocab words put together, which is why it's using the kun'yomi reading. The hiragana on the end is a hint!
814 | 思い出す | おもいだす | To Remember | To Recall | You know that 思う means to think (so 思い is "a thought"). You also know that 出す means "to remove." So, when you remove a thought, you are remembering something. This is a verb, so the verb form of remembering something is to remember. \n The reading for this word is the kun'yomi readings. You should know the words 思う and 出す and their readings, so you should be able to read this word if you know those words.
815 | 走り回る | はしりまわる | To Run Around |  | You've seen the words 走る (to run) and 回る (to revolve). So, when you're running and revolving while you're doing it, you're running in circles. So, the verb form of that is to run around. \n The readings are those like the words 走る and 回る. Make sure you know those words from before and apply that knowledge to read this word as well.

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nEvery time you try to speak, 花s (はな) just sprout out of your mouth preventing you. Imagine your mouth full of flowers. Taste them, spit them out, and try to speak again. Same problem.
817 | 支える | ささえる | To Support |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means support so the verb version is to support. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou need to support someone. In order to support them, you grab two saws. One saw and another saw.

819 | 回す | まわす | To Turn Something | To Rotate Something\n To Spin Something | You've probably seen the word 回る, which means "to revolve." This word is similar, except for you're doing the turning/rotating action on something else. You can simply say to turn something or to rotate something when answering this question, but be sure to think of yourself actually turning/rotating something. Remember this by using the す on the end. You've taken your friend Sue and put her on a stick. You're rotating her over a fire on a spit because you're a sick cannibal. \n The reading is the same as the word 回る (まわ). So long as you know that level 5 word, you'll be able to read this one as well. Use both of these words together to remember their readings.
820 | 点ける | つける | To Turn Something On | To Switch Something On\n To Light Something Up | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means point so the verb version is something you need to point your finger to do. Picture pointing your finger and pushing a lightswitch to turn something on, in this case the light. You won't be able to switch something on if you can't point your finger. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou aren't able to turn the light on with just one finger though, you need to use two (つ).

So this verb means to turn something towards or to point something at.\nIn order to remember that this word means "to turn something towards," focus on the け. You have a bottle of ketchup in your hands and you're turning it toward your worst enemy to spray them. Picture yourself pointing the ketchup toward them. \n The reading for this one is the same as 向く which you learned in a previous level. As long as you know that one you should be able to learn this one's reading as well.
822 | 電車 | でんしゃ | Train |  | You would think that an electricity car was an electric car, but this word was made before the days of the Prius. This refers to a train, which I guess was electric at some point. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
823 | 水道 | すいどう | Water Supply | Water Service\n Waterworks\n Aqueduct\n Conduit\n Water Line | A water road carries your water supply. In the old days, these were called aqueducts. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
824 | どこ | どこ | Where |  | Remember how words beginning with ど are often question words, and words ending in こ refer to places? This one's no exception, so どこ means where.
825 | 全身 | ぜんしん | Whole Body | Entire Body | The all of somebody is someone's whole body. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
826 | 森 | もり | Woods | Forest | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading, but that's the reading you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this one too.
827 | お前 | おまえ | You |  | The お is added to elevate someone in front of you. What do you call someone in front of you? That's right, you. Over time, this word has lost its sense of politeness, and nowadays it sounds very rough and often rude. This "you" is a good way to show anger, and some people also use it in very casual situations to show affection. \n The reading for 前 is the kun'yomi, like the reading for the vocabulary word 前. So long as you know that word, you'll be able to read this one too.
828 | 君 | きみ | You | Buddy | Okay, so the kanji itself means buddy and so does the word, but it also means you as well. This is one of the several ways to say "you" in Japanese, and this one is kind of an "affectionate" you. Maybe you'd say it with someone you're close to. Maybe you'd say it with a girlfriend or boyfriend. You wouldn't want to use it with your boss or teacher, though. Make sure to keep that in mind. It's kind of like saying "hey buddy" or "hey you," after all. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nWho's your buddy? It's Kimmy (きみ)! If you know a Kimmy, imagine her. If you don't, find a famous Kimmy or make up a Kimmy to imagine. You ask... is it you?? Wait, you're my buddy?

832 | 発表 | はっぴょう | Announcement | Presentation | I'm going to express my departure. That is my only announcement. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The ひょう changes to ぴょう and the はつ gets shortened, though, so just about everything about this word is weird.
833 | 記事 | きじ | Article | News Story\n Report\n Account\n News Article | When you write down a lot of stuff focusing on one thing it's called an article. If it's on something that just happened it will probably be a news story. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
834 | 仮定 | かてい | Assumption | Assume | A temporary determination is something you're not totally sure about. You've decided to think of something in a certain way, but only for now. If more information comes to light, you may change your mind. That's why this word means assumption.\n仮定 refers to making tentative assumptions about a specific situation to discuss what might happen under certain conditions, such as "if we assume I dropped my wallet here yesterday...” \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
835 | 通り | とおり | Avenue | Street\n Road\n Way | You know the word 通る hopefully by now. That is the verb version of this word, which means "to pass through." So, if this is the noun version, what is it that you use to pass through something? To drive or walk along? That would be an avenue (or street, road, etc). This is a pretty common word in Japan, and good for not getting lost. \n The reading is the same as the word 通る, so as long as you know that, you should be able to read this one as well. Mind the strange long お sound!
836 | 美しい | うつくしい | Beautiful |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. More precisely, it has しい on the end, which makes it even more likely it's an adjective. What's the adjective form of beauty? It's beautiful. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you. It's a long reading for a mnemonic, but try your best.\nYou look at someone who is beautiful. What an easy life they've lived. No hard work and all they do is pamper themselves to stay beautiful. Feel disgusted. You walk up to this person and say: "U too cushy! (うつくしい).\nSorry for adding the whole word in there for the reading mnemonic, but I thought it worked out better that way. Just know that the word isn't うつくしいしい or something weird like that. The hiragana on the end is part of the mnemonic as well.
837 | 美人 | びじん | Beautiful Woman |  | A beautiful person is a beautiful woman. Wait, why isn't this a beautiful person? In fact, this word used to have a broader meaning, but for some reason it's generally only used for women in modern Japanese. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nWhere you're from, every beautiful woman wears bee jeans (びじん). That's right, jeans made out of bees. Beauty knows no pain after all!
838 | 気を付けて | きをつけて | Be Careful | Take Care | This word contains the words 気 (energy) and 付ける (to attach). So, when you attach energy to something you're focusing in on it, right? This word is a sort of "order" as well, since it's te-form there at the end. It's a set phrase people say to other people who are doing dangerous things. It's kind of like saying "Attach energy to what you're doing! Stay focused!" A simpler way to translate this would be to say this word means be careful or take care, though. Learn this word so that you can always show that you're caring for your friends! \n The readings come from the two words 気 and 付ける. So long as you know those from the previous levels, you should be able to read this one as well.
839 | 白黒 | しろくろ | Black And White | White And Black | Something is both white and black. It is black and white (you can also say white and black if you prefer). \n The readings are kun'yomi, but you should have seen both 白 and 黒い separately as vocabulary by now. It's the same readings here, so you can apply that knowledge and read this word!
840 | 体重 | たいじゅう | Body Weight |  | How heavy is your body? Figure that out and you'll have your body weight. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

842 | 肉屋 | にくや | Butcher Shop | Meat Shop\n Meat Store | A meat shop is a place that sells meat. Who sells meat? A butcher shop. \n For 肉 you use the にく reading (which you learned with the kanji). For 屋 you use the kun'yomi, which you learned with the kanji. Basically, if you learned the kanji readings, you can read this word!
843 | 交代 | こうたい | Change | Substitution\n Shift | If you mix and substitute two people, that's a change of personnel, or a substitution. Perhaps those people are even working in shifts, so they mix and substitute each other at regular intervals.\nYou'll see this word in pretty diverse contexts, because it can refer to anything from a change of political regime, to the substitution of a player during a match, to factory shifts. The underlying meaning is that one person or group is switched out with another. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 代 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nA change calls for a tie (たい). If you're the new company president, or you're going in to work to start your shift, you'd better make sure you look the part, so get that tie nice and straight.
844 | 服 | ふく | Clothes | Clothing | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the reading you learned with the kanji and uses the on'yomi even though it's a single word. Very strange, but convenient for you so long as you remember this exception reading word.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
848 | 〜ヶ月 | かげつ | Counter For Months | Month Counter | Alright, so this one's a bit weird. See that oddly small ヶ there? Well, together with 月 (month), it becomes a counter for months. You'll use this when you want to talk about a specific number of months, so not when you're saying January, February, etc.\nNote that you'll run into different variants of this. While 一ヶ月 is the most common, you'll also encounter 一か月, 一カ月, and rarely 一箇月. Luckily, they're all read the same, just written differently. Speaking about reading, let's get to it. \n The little ヶ might be slightly misleading, as you'll have to read this as か. The rest is easy though, as 月 just takes a normal on'yomi reading. And since we're not talking about specific months, that means it's just げつ, making this 〜かげつ.
849 | 決定 | けってい | Decision | Determination | It's been decided and determined. The decision has been made. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

850 | 〜度 | ど | Degrees | Times | The kanji degree can mean both degree in terms of angles and degree in terms of temperature. This word is how you talk about these things. Just attach it to a number and you have yourself the number of degrees that something is. After the numbers 1, 2 and 3 (and in some other situations) this can also mean times. \n The reading is the same as the kanji reading you learned. When writing out the answer to this reading, omit the 〜 as it's only there to let you know that some other word should come before it.
851 | 出発 | しゅっぱつ | Departure |  | You exit and then make a departure. This is just a departure. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The しゅつ gets shortened and はつ changes to ぱつ. No wonder you want to make a departure, you want to get away from crazy readings like this.
852 | 不自由 | ふじゆう | Discomfort | Inconvenience\n Disability\n Impairment\n Poverty\n Destitution | Remember how 自由 means freedom?

You will go to see the unseen, and hopefully make a great discovery. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You know the はつ part, which gets shortened to はっ. The 見 is unlike what you learned with 見, though.\nIn order to remember that this is けん, imagine you're going out to make a discovery of some strange new lands. With strange new lands, there comes strange new people. This one has a samurai named Ken けん on it. He's trying to discover new things too!
854 | 二重 | にじゅう | Double | Dual | When you have two heavy things, you have double and dual the heavy (compared to one, at least).\nThis word is a prefix attached to other words to show that it is "double." 二重 kanji time! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

856 | 楽勝 | らくしょう | Easy Victory | Easy Win\n Piece Of Cake | A win that was an ease. That is an easy victory or an easy win. Don't hope for a lot of these, though. Hope for tough wins instead, they actually make you better.\nNote that this can be used both literally, to describe an easy victory at a game or contest; or more figuratively, to describe something as “easy” in general. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
857 | 小学校 | しょうがっこう | Elementary School | Primary School\n Grade School | You've seen 学校 from a couple levels ago. Now we're adding a small to it. What is a "small school"? That's a school for small people, making it an elementary school. \n The reading is the regular on'yomi reading of 小 plus the vocab word 学校 that you've seen previously. Combine these two things for the reading of 小学校.
858 | 重要 | じゅうよう | Essential | Important\n Necessary | When something has a heavy need, you know that that thing is essential. It is important. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
859 | 丁度 | ちょうど | Exactly | Just | Okay, we're going to cheat a little bit to remember the meaning of this word. Let's say you take the temperature of the street. It is exactly one hundred degrees. That's exactly what it is. Just 100 degrees, not one degree more or less. You put your eggs on the street and watch them cook. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
860 | 試験 | しけん | Examination | Test\n Experiment | If you attempt a test, you're taking an examination. There are a lot of these in Japan, so make sure you know this word if you want to fit in with all the whining and whinging that students do, especially come the final year of high school. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
861 | 体験 | たいけん | Experience |  | Your body goes through tests and each time it does, it gains a little more experience. What has your body experienced? What tests has your body been through? \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
862 | 実験 | じっけん | Experiment |  | A test that tries to find truth is an experiment. This is because you don't know the truth, so the only way to find it is to try things out and test them. Thus, experiment! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Take note that the つ in じつ is turned into a small っ, though.
863 | 事実 | じじつ | Fact | Factual\n In Fact | The occurrence of truth is a fact.\n事実 is primarily used as a noun, but it can also be used to say something is factual. Additionally, in relatively formal writing it can be used as an adverb to mean in fact. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
864 | 火事 | かじ | Fire |  | A fire matter is a fire, as in the destructive burning of something. There's a fire! Run, run away!\n火事 is often used for when houses or other buildings are on fire. If you hear someone shout 火事だ, it's probably time to get out of wherever you are. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
865 | 魚屋 | さかなや | Fish Shop | Fish Market\n Fish Dealer\n Fish Store\n Fishmonger | A fish shop is a fish shop, a place from which you buy fish. Especially in Japan, very important. \n The kun'yomi reading is used for the 魚 (so it's さかな) and the kun'yomi reading is used for 屋 (や). You'll have to use the reading of 魚 from the vocabulary from a couple levels ago to remember the reading of this one.
866 | 試食 | ししょく | Food Sample | Taste | Go ahead and try an eat. How was that little try? That little food sample? That little taste?\nYou know when you walk into the supermarket and have people offering you the tiniest cube of cheese? That's what this is. So this word is commonly used in the context of product demonstrations or food events. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
867 | 映像 | えいぞう | Footage | Video\n Image | You see reflections of a statue on a screen, and the statue reflections are moving! That means this is footage, or video.\n映像 refers to images in various forms of visual media. While it's most commonly used to describe moving images in videos or films, it can also refer to mental images — those pictures or scenes that come to mind, reflecting personal memories or imagination. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
868 | 表 | おもて | Front | Exterior\n Face\n Outside\n Appearance | This is the noun version of the kanji express. If you want to understand what something is trying to express you usually look at its front or its exterior. This word is usually used for the exterior face of buildings. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou're standing in front of a building, staring at its front. You spend some time gazing at it before you realize what it is. "Oh, motel (おもて)", you say aloud. A little time looking at the exterior and you're able to figure it out.
869 | 家具 | かぐ | Furniture |  | Your house tools aren't the tools you use to build a house. They're more like the things that are a part of your house that you use like tools. Those things would be your furniture. So, remember, your house tools are just furniture. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You learned the か reading with 家事, but here's a mnemonic in case you need a refresher:\nThe best kind of furniture is a car (か). If you think about it, anybody would be impressed to find a car inside your house. Is that a car, they'd ask. Oh, that's just a piece of furniture, you'd say, I use it as a bed. Car furniture is such a flex.
870 | ガラス | ガラス | Glass | Pane of Glass | This comes from the word glass, and it refers to the stuff used to make Cinderella's slippers, and windows, in which case it can also mean a pane of glass.\nWe'll learn how to say the other meanings of "glass" later!
871 | お客さん | おきゃくさん | Guest | Visitor\n Customer | The さん on the end is the name honorific さん. It's there to show some respect. It's like saying "Mr. Guest!" or something like that. But that sounds dumb in English. We'll just call this word guest, visitor, or customer. You'll hear this word a lot when you're at a store or you're a customer somewhere in Japan. You are the お客さん, in that situation. Alternatively, you'll also hear お客さま which is a more polite version of this word (because it ends in さま and not さん). \n The reading is the reading you learned with the kanji. Just add the hiragana on the end and you'll be good to go.
872 | 客室 | きゃくしつ | Guest Room |  | A guest's room is the guest room (the room you put guests in, duh!). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
873 | ハート形 | はーとがた | Heart Shaped |  | ハート is of course "heart" and you know that 形 means shape. You've probably already figured this one out. It's heart shaped.\nYou can add this kanji to all sorts of other things too to say "____ shaped." Give it a try! \n The reading for the kanji portion uses the kun'yomi reading. This is kind of like the reading you already learned for 形 just without the ち part. And rendaku happens too, so it becomes がた. If you can remember that, you should be able to remember this reading too!
874 | 高さ | たかさ | Height |  | You've seen the word 高い from a couple levels ago. This word is related to that. It's like 大きい versus 大きさ, where one describes the other. In this case, the 高さ is the height of something (while 高い is tall). This word isn't "price" though. For that you'd ask いくらですか？ (how much is it?). \n Use the reading of 高い (たかい) to help you to learn and remember the reading for this one. They're the same except for the hiragana at the end.
875 | 高校生 | こうこうせい | High School Student | High Schooler | You know 高校 means "high school." So, a "life" that does high school is a high school student. This is like how 中学生 are middle school students and 小学生 are elementary school students! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Use the reading of 高校 from before to learn the reading of this word as well, if it helps.
876 | 家事 | かじ | Housework | Chores | You know 事 means "occurrence," but it also means "matter." So you can think of a house matter as  as housework or chores. Housework and chores are really just house matters that you have to deal with, after all. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading of 家 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nHousework done in a car (か) is still housework. Think of all the times you've tidied up your car. That's housework too!
877 | 何度 | なんど | How Many Times | How Often\n What Temperature | If someone asks you what occurrence or what degrees they're really trying to ask you how many times something happened. Sometimes they're asking what temperature it is too. \n The reading is a combination of kun'yomi and on'yomi readings. That being said, both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned already, so you should be able to read this.
878 | 画像 | がぞう | Image | Picture | An image of an image is still an image. This can also be a picture.\n画像 can refer to all sorts of images and pictures, but these days it's mostly used for the digital kind. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
879 | 大事 | だいじ | Important | Valuable | You know 事 means "occurrence," but it can also mean "matter." And if something is a  big matter to someone, it must be a very important and valuable thing to them.\n大事 describes something that holds great importance or value. For example, you can use 大事 to describe something or someone that matters a lot to you. You can also use 大事 to describe a crucial task or moment. And if you want to bring up a serious topic, you may say that you have something 大事 to talk about. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nNothing in your life is as important or valuable to you as dyes (だい). You really just love dyes more than anything else. Dyes, dyes, dyes!
880 | 和風 | わふう | Japanese Style |  | The Japanese style style. The Japanese often like to think they're very unique and have a very special kind of style (and often times they do). So, you'll hear this word used when someone wants to describe this unique sense of style. Wafuuuu!\nNote that this word uses alternative kanji meanings in both of the kanji. They're in the kanji explanation, but they're not the primaries, so it may take a little extra effort to learn this word depending on what you studied! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
881 | 和服 | わふく | Japanese Style Clothes | Japanese Clothing\n Japanese Style Clothing\n Japanese Clothes | Japanese style clothes (Japanese Style Clothes). We're talking kimonos and yukata and things like that. Basically, this differentiates Japanese clothing from Western clothing.\nWhat kind of clothes will you wear to the festival tonight? Oh, probably some 和服. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
882 | 和食 | わしょく | Japanese Style Food | Japanese Food | Japanese style eat ... well, let's change "eat" to "food" and you have Japanese style food. This is a good way to differentiate between an American style restaurant and a Japanese style restaurant. What kind of food you feeling like tonight? Oh, how about some 和食? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
883 | 和室 | わしつ | Japanese Style Room |  | A Japanese style room tends to be pretty small. This mainly refers to the kind of room that's covered in tatami mats, though. If you're looking for places to stay in Japan, a 和室 will be something like that. You'll pull the futon out of the closet and sleep on the floor. So comfy, these Japanese style rooms! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
884 | 仮名 | かな | Kana |  | The temporary names. These are the kana (that's hiragana and katakana). Why are kana the "temporary names" though? Maybe they were just meant to be a temporary way to write the names of the kanji you didn't know how to write yet. That's just a guess, but it should help you remember that this word means "kana." \n Okay, so 仮 uses the rare kun'yomi reading か, which you haven't learned yet, but luckily it's the same as the on'yomi you have learned! And 名 also uses a kun'yomi reading that you learned with the vocab word 名 (な). So you sort of know these readings already, but it's a lot to take in, so here's a mnemonic to help:\nThe reading is so tricky for kana that it makes you say かな… (I wonder…) whenever you try to read it. You keep thinking, "Is the reading kana, かな? Or could it be something else, かな?" You're just not sure.
885 | 空手 | からて | Karate |  | What can you do with empty hands? Karate, that's what. Karate is practiced without weapons, so with empty hands! \n This word uses the kun'yomi of both kanji, and you haven't learned this kun'yomi for 空 yet. As long as you know the meaning, the reading should be easy, but here's a mnemonic to help you just in case:\nKarate comes from (から) Japan!
886 | 保持 | ほじ | Keep | Hold\n Maintain\n Retain | When you preserve the things you hold on to, you're keeping them. In other words, you're holding and maintaining them!\nNote that 保持 is a formal word that's commonly used in professional or official contexts. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
887 | キロ | キロ | Kilo | Kilogram\n Kilometer\n Kilowatt | キロ comes from kilo, and it can mean kilogram, kilometer, or any unit that starts with "kilo" in English.\nYou can also use abbreviations like "kg" and "km" in Japanese, and they're often just pronounced キロ too.
888 | 生保 | せいほ | Life Insurance |  | A Life guarantee is something you get on someone else. If their life ends, it's guaranteed with money. That's a life insurance policy, for yah! (A.K.A. life assurance in some parts of the world!) \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
889 | 明かり | あかり | Light |  | What makes it bright around here? It's the light!\nNow you might wonder: how is this different from 光 (ひかり)? 光 is more general, and often used specifically for sunlight. 明かり often refers to some specific source of light, like the kind that illuminates a room, so it's often used for light that comes from lamps. \n Do you remember the adjective 明るい (あかるい), meaning "bright"? As you can see, these words are quite similar! You just need to remember that the か in 明かり isn't part of the kanji, like in 明るい.
890 | 生物 | せいぶつ | Living Thing | Creature\n Organism | A life thing is a living thing, a creature, or an organism. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
891 | 名物 | めいぶつ | Local Specialty | Famous Product\n Specialty\n Famous Goods | The famous thing of an area is their famous product, but it sounds better in English if you say it's the local specialty. When you're traveling around Japan, be sure to be on the lookout for the 名物! It's always fun. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
892 | 要点 | ようてん | Main Point | Gist\n Main Idea\n Essence | The needed point is the main point. It's the gist of what you're trying to say. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
893 | 勝負 | しょうぶ | Match | Showdown\n A Gamble | Win, lose... both will happen in tonight's match! What a showdown it will be!\nNote that 勝負 can also describe situations where one takes a significant risk or makes a bold move— a gamble —with high stakes involved. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just remember that ふ becomes ぶ because of rendaku here.
894 | 食事 | しょくじ | Meal | Diet\n Dining | A regular eating occurrence is also known as a meal.\n食事 can refer to a specific meal, like breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It can also mean your overall diet, like the kinds of foods you usually eat. 食事 can even be a verbal noun for the act of dining, so 食事する can be used to talk about having a meal. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
895 | 中学校 | ちゅうがっこう | Middle School | Junior High School | You know that 学校 means school. So, people who are in the middle school are in... wait for it... middle school.\nAnd, of course, if you're one of those people that call it junior high school you can do that too. \n The reading is a combination of 学校 and 中. Really, it's all on'yomi too, so you should be able to read this one. Take note of the がく turning to がっ, though.
896 | ほとんど | ほとんど | Most | Almost All\n Hardly | What can be eaten hot on dough (ほとんど)? Most things can. Almost all things, in fact. Hardly anything tastes bad when it's hot and served on dough.
897 | 辛子 | からし | Mustard | Japanese Mustard\n Karashi | The spicy child is the child of spicy. So, not as spicy as mamma spicy, but still a bit spicy. This child spicy is mustard. Not too spicy, but not too mild.\n辛子 generally refers to Japanese mustard, which tends to be browner and stronger than マスタード (Western mustard). Sometimes, especially as a prefix, it can also indicate spiciness from red pepper, like 辛子マヨネーズ (spicy mayo). \n The reading is 辛い (からい) and the on'yomi reading for 子 combined together. It's one of those weird words that mixes the on'yomi and kun'yomi readings.
898 | 名古屋 | なごや | Nagoya |  | The place that's famous for old roofs. I don't know why, but it's the city of Nagoya. Just associate the two things together and it'll be hard to forget (so long as you've heard of Nagoya before - if not, read up about it!). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji (except for 名 and 屋, which are kun'yomi here). If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. For な just think to 名前 (なまえ) which uses the な reading. The "name" (名前) of this city is what? It's Nagoya. Watch out for rendaku changing こ to ご too.
899 | 必要 | ひつよう | Necessary | Needed\n Essential | It's certain that you need it. This thing is necessary. It is needed. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
900 | 付近 | ふきん | Neighborhood | Vicinity\n Environs\n Nearby\n Locality | If you attach things near you, they end up being in the same neighborhood as you. They're attached nearby so they can't go much further. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for 付 though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYour neighborhood is full of fools (ふ). Fools everywhere. You're probably one too, since you live nearby.
901 | 新しい | あたらしい | New |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of new? It's new. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYour family buys you a new Atari! You're so excited! But wait... what's this? This is no Atari. This is an Atara... a knockoff video game system :(
902 | 新年 | しんねん | New Year |  | A new year is a new year. Hope you had / have / are having a good one, depending on when you read this. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
903 | 海 | うみ | Ocean | Sea | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou visit the sea. Strangely, it asks you who is visiting. You're so full of yourself (even in front of the sea/ocean) that you reply: "um, me?" (うみ). Imagine yourself feeling this full of yourself.
904 | 一ヶ月 | いっかげつ | One Month |  | Remember the 〜ヶ月 counter? Replace the 〜 with a one and this becomes one month. \n 一 uses the on'yomi you learned with it, but gets shortened, so watch out for that. The rest is as you learned it!
905 | 出身 | しゅっしん | One's Origin | One's Hometown\n One's Birthplace | The exit that somebody starts from is one's origin, one's hometown, or one's birthplace. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Just watch out for the つ of 出, which becomes っ.
906 | 元々 | もともと | Originally | From The Beginning\n By Nature | It's the origin of all origins, so it's the way it was originally, from the beginning, or by nature. You get the idea.\nNote that this is frequently written in just hiragana, but you'll encounter the kanji version too! \n This is just the kun'yomi reading you learned with 元, but twice, so you should be good to go!
907 | あそこ | あそこ | Over There |  | Remember how words beginning with あ show that whatever you're talking about is far away from both you and the person you're talking to? And how words ending in こ refer to places? So what do you think this means? That right, it's over there.\nJust watch out for the extra そ in this word. If you need help remembering this, imagine a sock oh (あそこ) so far over there. It's lucky that it's so far over there, because that sock stinks. You can still smell it, even though it's all the way over there in the distance.
908 | 苦しい | くるしい | Painful | Agonizing | This word ends in い, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. In fact, it ends in しい, which makes it even more likely it's an adjective. The kanji 苦 means suffering, so what could a related adjective be? This word means painful or agonizing. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nEverything is really painful right now. Why? You have something heavy on top of you, crushing (くる) you.
909 | 平和 | へいわ | Peace | Harmony | The flat peace. This is a peace that will last, because there's no waves... no ripples... just flat. This is plain old peace. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

As long as you know the readings for these kanji, you should be able to read this word just fine.
912 | 〜県 | けん | Prefecture |  | Attach this word onto the end of a prefecture place name and you have the prefecture portion of _____ prefecture. These are a lot like states or provinces. \n The reading for this is the same as what you learned with the kanji, probably because it's always attached to things (so it's like jukugo). Don't write the 〜 when you're writing in the answer, just the けん portion, and you'll get this one correct.
913 | 発音 | はつおん | Pronunciation |  | The sound that departs from your mouth is you talking. Imagine yourself saying things and words departing your mouth. They are bent in different ways and have different colors, highlighting your pronunciation of certain words and phrases. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
914 | 心強い | こころづよい | Reassuring | Heartening | Things that make your heart strong are reassuring and heartening to hear. You can practically feel your heart becoming stronger in your chest. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You learned them when you learned the words 心 and 強い, so you should be able to read this on your own. Just note that つよい gets rendaku'd to づよい!

And if you return the matter to another person, you're giving a reply or response. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
916 | 住民 | じゅうみん | Residents | Citizens | They dwell here, these people. So what are they? They’re residents. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
917 | 部屋 | へや | Room |  | If you have a part of a roof, that part is your room. Just imagine a roof divided into sections in a house, with the sections going all the way down to the ground. Each section is its own room, right? \n 部屋 is a bit tricky because it's one of the few Japanese words that use the へ reading for 部. You'll just have to remember this one is special. Here's a mnemonic to help you out:\nImagine you're renting out a room, but all you hear at night is a constant "heh (へ)… heh... heh... hehehe". An incessant snickering, coming from somewhere inside your room. Hehehe.
918 | 発売 | はつばい | Sale | Selling | You want things to depart from your store so you have to sell them. You put all these things up for sale. You are selling these items. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
919 | 辛い | からい | Spicy | Hot\n Difficult\n Painful | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. That being said, this can also mean difficult or painful, often in a psychological sense, though it can be physical as well. I guess if you're in a spicy situation it's going to be a difficult one. \n Depending on the context, the reading for this word could be からい or つらい.\nThe からい reading is the spicy one that you learned with the kanji, which you can remember because spicy foods give a からて chop to your mouth.\nThe つらい reading is the difficult or painful one. You can remember this because two Ras (つら) are way more difficult to deal with than one Ra.
920 | 辛口 | からくち | Spicy Taste | Dry Taste\n Dry Tasting\n Harsh | If you put something spicy in your mouth you'll end up with a spicy taste or a dry taste in there. Spice sucks up all your mouth moistness. \n This is the kun'yomi readings together. You should have learned them both by now.
921 | 立場 | たちば | Standpoint | Position | Your stand location is your standpoint or your position.\nNote that 立場 usually refers to the position somebody takes in a particular situation, but can also refer to somebody's position in society. \n This is a bit of a weird one, since it uses kun'yomi and not on'yomi. What's more, how you read 立 is slightly different from what you'd expect. So here's a mnemonic to help you remember how to read 立 this time:\nTalking about your standpoint can be a touchy (たち) subject. You should watch out since people can get touchy when you give your standpoint on things!
922 | 星 | ほし | Star |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nA star is just a whole sheep (ほし) floating in the sky. If it wasn't a whole sheep, it wouldn't shine so brightly and you wouldn't be able to see it from Earth. Don't let anyone tell you stars are made of gas. The whole thing is sheep, okay?
923 | 〜屋 | や | Store | Shop | You'll see this attached to other words... like "meat" or "fish." When you see this, you'll know it is a ___ store, making this word mean store (same as the kanji). \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading. Don't type the 〜 out when writing the answer. It's just there to let you know that there's usually something attached to this word.
924 | 仮に | かりに | Supposing | If | The kanji itself means temporary. When you add the に, we're asking you to imagine a situation temporarily, so the meaning changes to supposing or if. \n The reading is kun'yomi, so here's a mnemonic to remember it:\nIf you don't mind, could you carry (かり) this for me? Supposing it's not too much trouble, of course.
925 | 必勝 | ひっしょう | Sure Victory | Certain Victory\n Sure Win\n Certain Win | A certain win sounds like a great thing. When these two kanji are put together, a certain victory is inevitable. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Take note that the つ in ひつ is turned into a small っ, though.
926 | 泳ぎ | およぎ | Swimming | Swim | This is the noun version of the kanji swim, so it means swimming. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already so you should be able to read it!
927 | 目次 | もくじ | Table Of Contents |  | Your eye is on what's next. How is this possible to see what's coming up? That's because you're looking at a table of contents. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
928 | 札 | ふだ | Tag | Amulet\n Label\n Playing Card | This word is almost the same as the kanji, but only half of it. It means tag or amulet. They're about the same shape and size as money, but you can't buy a house with them (...probably). \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou can't find your tag anywhere. It was just there, you swear, but now it's nowhere to be found. You search for it everywhere, then you realize... it was right there all along. Seriously? You're such a fool, duh (ふだ)!
929 | 受験 | じゅけん | Taking An Exam | Taking A Test | When you accept a test you are taking an exam or taking a test. Good luck! A++++! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
930 | 対談 | たいだん | Talk | Discussion\n Interview | A versus talk is when you sit down with another person and have a talk. As you're talking, it might evolve into a discussion. Or perhaps you're there to have an interview.\n対談 is usually a formal discussion between two or more individuals, often organized ahead of time, and with a specific purpose or topic in mind. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
931 | 用事 | ようじ | Task | Errand\n Things To Do | If there's a task occurrence, then there's something you have to do, a.k.a. a task or errand.\n用事 generally refers to tasks that you personally need to take care of. Often that means errands like buying groceries or paying bills. It could also mean a doctor's appointment, meeting with a friend, or work tasks like attending a meeting and finishing an assignment. It's anything on your list of things to do! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
932 | 教え | おしえ | Teaching | Instruction\n Teachings\n Lesson\n Doctrine | This is the noun version of the kanji teach. So it means teaching. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading when you learned 教える, so you should be able to read this word as well.
933 | 茶屋 | ちゃや | Tea Shop | Tea Store\n Tea House | A tea shop is a tea shop. Mmm, delicious, delicious tea. \n This word uses the readings you learned with the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
934 | 十分間 | じゅっぷんかん | Ten Minutes |  | You've got a ten minute interval of time. That simply makes this ten minutes.\nNote that, as we mentioned on the page for 〜間, you can omit 間 and this will still mean ten minutes! You'll especially see this in conversations and more casual contexts. \n This is a jukugo word, which means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You do know all of those, but their behaviour is a little different here. 十 (じゅう) and 分 (～ふん) together actually turn into じゅっぷん here. This is sometimes the case when using ～分 to mean "minute" in combination with certain numbers, so try to pay attention to this!
935 | そこ | そこ | There |  | Remember how words beginning with そ are either close to the person you're talking to, or fairly close to both of you? And how words ending in こ refer to places? This one's no exception. そこ means there.
936 | 世界 | せかい | The World | Society\n The Universe | Both kanji mean world, so it should be easy to guess this is a word for the World. It also means society or the Universe. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You know the on'yomi reading for 界, but you didn't learn this on'yomi reading of 世, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\nWhat's the most hated vegetable in the world? Celery (せ), probably. The world is divided into those who love celery and those who hate celery. Which one are you?
937 | 事 | こと | Thing | Matter\n Occurrence | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nAs a vocab word on its own, 事 usually refers to an intangible or abstract thing, like いい事 (good thing) or する事 (things to do).\nDepending on the context, it can also mean matter or occurrence, like 大切な事 (important matter) or きのうの事 (what happened yesterday). \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned that reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you out:\nYou've done all kinds of things in your coat (こと). If you think about it, you only wear a coat when you have things to do. Try to remember all the things you've done in a coat. It's a lot! Symbolically, your coat = all the things and occurrences you've experienced, and all the matters you've had to deal with in life.
938 | 物 | もの | Thing | Object\n Item | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Besides thing, it has the related meanings of object and item. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading, but you haven't learned it yet. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhat game has the most things in it? Monopoly (もの). You can choose from a bunch of random things to play as, you know? And no one actually knows what those things are. What's a thimble anyway? Just call it a thing.
939 | 今度 | こんど | This Time | Next Time | In the now occurrence you'll learn your kanji, no? This word means this time. Despite being "this time" it has the feeling of next time, though. It's like saying "okay, this time we'll get it" where "this time" really means "next time," making it a little bit different from 今回. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
940 | 付く | つく | To Be Attached |  | You know that the word 付ける means "to attach" and you know that the kanji 付 means attach. So, this word probably has something to do with attaching. This is the intransitive version, though, where something is attached (and you're not doing the attaching). You can use the く as a hint. You see something attached on the wall. You say "Coo'" \n The reading can be derived from 付ける, a word you should have seen a few levels ago. If you know that word's reading you should be able to figure out this word's reading as well (and vice versa).
941 | 曲がる | まがる | To Be Bent | To Bend\n To Curve\n To Turn | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means both music and bend. In the case of this word, we're looking at "bend." So, the verb form of bend is to be bent. This is when something bends on its own, not when you're doing the bending. It's just bending. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading with 曲げる, so you should be good to go!
942 | 下る | くだる | To Descend | To Go Down | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means below, so you can guess the direction this movement verb takes: this is to descend, or to go down.\nAs a movement verb, it usually describes a gradual downward movement. For example, you'd use this verb to describe walking down a mountain, driving down a hill, or going down a river in a boat. \n This verb uses the exceptional reading that 下さい also uses. So just replace the さい with る and you're good to go!
943 | 表す | あらわす | To Express Something | To Show Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means express and the verb vocab version is transitive, meaning that it's done to something. So this verb means to express something or to show something. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou're trying not to say it directly, but trying to figure out how to express something. That something is that you are a wuss (あらわす). Sorry, had to be expressed.
944 | 見付ける | みつける | To Find | To Find Something | You know that 付ける means "to attach" and that 見 means "see." So, when you attach your seeing to something, it's like you're looking around trying to find something. When you find what you're looking for, imagine your eyeballs flying out and attaching to that item, then yelling "I FOUND IT!"\nYou'll usually see this word with the 付 in kana, so 見つける. \n The readings come from 見る and 付ける. If you use those readings, you'll be able to read this word too.
945 | 欠ける | かける | To Get Chipped | To Be Lacking | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means lack, and this verb has a few meanings related to that. You'll often see it meaning to get chipped, like when talking about a teacup or your teeth. I guess a chipped teacup is lacking... a piece of itself?\n欠ける can also literally mean to be lacking, as in "a good goalie is lacking from their team." You can use it like this when you're short of something, or when something is missing that would complete a set. In these situations, you'll usually see it as 欠けている! \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nSomething is lacking... it's a car (か). You can't stop thinking about this because you have to walk 40 miles to get to your destination. If only that car wasn't missing, this would be easier. Imagine the sweat... the pain... the thirst... all because that car's not present.
946 | 持つ | もつ | To Hold Something | To Carry Something\n To Own Something\n To Keep Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means hold and the verb version is to hold something, to carry something, to own something, or to keep something.\nThis is a transitive verb, meaning it takes a direct object. You hold something, like chopsticks, have something, like power, or keep something, like your friend's book over the weekend. \n If you try to hold something in your hand long enough it will mold (も). And then that mold will cover your hand, then your arm, then your entire body. Basically, you should never hold anything for too long or you'll become a mold person.
947 | 交わる | まじわる | To Intersect | To Cross\n To Mingle | You know that the kanji means mix and the word 交ぜる means "to mix," so it probably has something to do with that. This word means to intersect, which is kind of like mixing. When two things intersect with each other, they're getting mixed up, so that's where this word gets its meaning.\nTo remember that this one means "to intersect," remember the わ as walk. You're walking around, and then you intersect with some people on the street. \n The reading is almost the same as 交ぜる which you should be familiar with by now. It has the ま but it also has an extra じ in there. That じ is there because you intersect with a group of mages (まじ) that catch you on fire as you walk past.
948 | 通す | とおす | To Let Something Pass | To Put Something Through | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. You already learned that 通る means to pass, but this is a little different. You aren't the one passing, Sue (す) is. So you have to let Sue pass. In other words, this verb is transitive, meaning it has an object. That's why it means to let something pass or to put something through.\nThe way this verb is translated into English changes a lot depending on the noun it's paired with. For example 火を通す is literally "to let the fire pass through", and means "to heat through". 針に糸を通す is literally "to put thread through a needle", so means "to thread a needle". \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned 通る. Switch the る for a す and you'll be all set!
949 | 負ける | まける | To Lose | To Be Defeated | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means lose so the verb vocab version means to lose. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou lose your tournament/soccer game/whatever (you decide something applicable to you). You're sad about this. Who's there to comfort you? Your Ma (ま). She's a nice lady.
950 | 要る | いる | To Need | To Be Needed\n To Be Necessary | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means need and the verb vocab version is to need.\nThis one's a little tricky, because although it's usually translated as "to need" in English, it's used more like to be needed or to be necessary. That is, it's an intransitive verb in Japanese, so it doesn't take a direct object. \n Since the reading isn't like the one you learned, think about what you are going to need... like, what you're really going to need, more than anything. Then, think of an eagle, because you really need an eagle. You'll need to come up with the reason why you need an eagle though, so hopefully it's a good one.
951 | 道具 | どうぐ | Tool |  | The tools you use on the road of life are important to have. What is your most important tool? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
952 | 保つ | たもつ | To Preserve Something | To Keep Something\n To Maintain Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means preserve and the verb vocab version is to preserve something, to keep something, or to maintain something.\nThis is a transitive verb, so it takes a direct object. You preserve something, like your youth. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nIf you want to learn how to preserve something like fruits and veggies, you should start with tamots (たも), that's slang for delish tomatoes. Once they're preserved, you get to make everyone you love eat those yummy tamots. Mmm!
953 | 受ける | うける | To Receive Something | To Accept Something\n To Take Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means receive, and this verbs means just about the same thing: to receive something!\nThis is a transitive verb, so it takes a direct object. But 受ける often implies passive reception, generally of intangible objects like an education, or damage. It can also mean to take something, like taking an exam or a job offer. \n There’s a creature in front of you that’s about to receive something, but what is it? It’s an uni (う), and it’s going to receive a warm welcome and an education. Picture the sea urchin receiving these things, and then going on to take an exam to prove how much education it’s received.
954 | 受け取る | うけとる | To Receive Something | To Take Something\n To Get Something | You know that 受ける means "to receive something." Combine it with 取る (to take something), and 受け取る… still means to receive something.\nHowever, while 受ける generally implies passive reception, 受け取る carries a stronger connotation of actively taking possession of something. It is used when receiving a package or gift, or even when interpreting someone's words as having a specific meaning, such as an insult or compliment. \n If you know how to read 受ける and 取る, you should be good to go.
955 | 返す | かえす | To Return Something | To Return | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means return so the verb version means to return something.\nThis is more like "to return a thing" rather than returning home, which would be 帰る, a word you haven't seen yet (but will soon, I'm sure!). \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to return the Car egg (かえ) you found on the side of the road. It will birth a little car, but it needs its mother. So, you try to figure out how to return it. Go ahead and think through that process in your mind. Also think about how weird a car egg would be.
956 | 乗る | のる | To Ride | To Get On\n To Board | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means ride so the verb vocab version means to ride. \n The reading is kun'yomi (see that hiragana?) but that's the reading you learned with the kanji. Enjoy the ride!
957 | 売る | うる | To Sell Something |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means sell, so the verb version of that is to sell something. \n You want to sell something, but what? What can you sell that will take the least amount of work? Uni (う)! They're just hanging out in the ocean, ready for the taking. Go scoop some up, watch out for the pointy bits, and sell them for some quick cash!
958 | 送る | おくる | To Send Something | To Escort Someone | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means send, and the the vocab verb version is to send something. If the object of this verb is a person, it means "to send" in the sense of to escort someone, maybe to the station, or to the door. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou need to send an entire oak (おく) tree in the mail, but it's too big. Imagine yourself dragging one to the post office. They tell you that you can't send that here... Go to the oak sending facilities.
959 | 泳ぐ | およぐ | To Swim |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means swim so the verb vocab version is to swim. \n The reading is kun'yomi (see that hiragana sticking out?) but that's the reading you learned with the kanji.
960 | 試みる | こころみる | To Try To Do Something | To Attempt Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means try so the verb vocab version is to try to do something or to attempt something.\nThis verb is transitive, meaning it takes a direct object. Here, the direct object is whatever it is that you're trying to do. \n You know how when you try to do something you put your whole heart into it? Well, think of that in Japanese. You put your whole 心 (こころ) into it.
961 | 使う | つかう | To Use | To Spend | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means use so the verb version is to use. If you're talking about money, this can also mean to spend. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nTwo cars (つか), are what you have to use because you're so huge you don't fit into one. You've got a British car on your left and an American car on your right, and you're driving them both at the same time.
962 | 勝つ | かつ | To Win |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means win so the verb version is to win. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhat did you just win? You won a new car (か)!
963 | 実力 | じつりょく | True Strength | True Ability\n True Power | The truth behind someone's strength is their true strength. It is also their true ability. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 力 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nYour true strength is sealed behind two locks. Gee, two locks (じつりょく)?! People must have been scared of your true power to seal it behind two locks!
964 | 実 | じつ | Truth | Reality | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the on'yomi reading, same like you learned with the kanji. That is the truth, I promise.
965 | 使用 | しよう | Use | Application\n Employment | Something you use that has a use has... well, use. You can even use it for practical applications.\n使用 has a slightly more formal tone compared to 使う, and it’s preferred in situations that require a more precise and less casual choice of words. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
966 | 弱虫 | よわむし | Weakling | Coward | A weak insect. This is what people call weaklings in Japan. This is a good word to know if you're a bully, or something. \n The reading for this one is a weird one. It uses the kun'yomi readings for both, meaning you'll have to pull your knowledge of the word 弱い from earlier and apply it here. 虫 should be okay, though, as this is the reading you learned with the kanji.\nJust remember, only weak bugs use kun'yomi, and that weak bug is you in this instance.
967 | 弱々しい | よわよわしい | Weak Looking | Frail\n Weak Seeming\n Seemingly Weak | Something that is double weak is probably pretty weak. You also know that this is an adjective because it ends with い. You know that 弱い is weak, so it probably isn't that. Instead, this one is weak looking or frail. If you know the grammar らしい you can kind of use that as a hint. The しい on the end reminds me of らしい which is like "seems to be." So, "seems to be weak" = "weak looking." \n The reading is double kun'yomi, as you can probably guess due to all the hiragana involved. So, you double up on よわ and then add the しい to read this vocabulary word.
968 | 勝者 | しょうしゃ | Winner | Victor | Someone who wins is the winner / victor. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

970 | 足し算 | たしざん | Addition |  | Remember how 足す means "to add?" Add calculate to that and you'll have addition! It's the type of calculation you're doing when you add. \n This is the kun'yomi reading for 足 and the on'yomi for 算. And the さん reading is rendaku'd into ざん. This is the same for all the math-ish words (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), so try to remember that, because you'll see it again!
971 | 進行 | しんこう | Advance | Progress | When something advances and goes, it is moving forward. So this means advance or progress.\n進行 can be used to describe various situations, like when a project progresses; but also when an illness advances to a more serious stage. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
972 | 農業 | のうぎょう | Agriculture |  | What's another way to call the farming business? If you encapsulated it into one word (assuming we're talking about plant farming, here), you could call it agriculture. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
973 | ちょっと | ちょっと | A Little | A Moment | You chortle (ちょっと) a little at a silly joke. You can’t help chortling for a moment. Go ahead, chortle just a little, for just a moment, to help you remember this word.
974 | 路地 | ろじ | Alley | Path\n Dirt Road | If you think about it, an earth road isn't going to be the main road. It will be the road less traveled. You could call it a path (you know, like a dirt path!) or a dirt road. Alternatively, another less traveled street that would probably be made out of dirt back in the day (before everything was paved) would be an alley. Imagine yourself walking down a dirt alley at night with no shoes. Scary! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You've learned these readings already, so you should be able to read this word too! And remember, that it's the じ reading that you learned with 生地 here.
975 | 高度 | こうど | Altitude | High-level | Something that is tall in degrees can either refer to its altitude, or to the fact that it's quite high-level.\nNote that this can refer to any altitude, even lower ones.

987 | 集金 | しゅうきん | Collecting Money | Money Collection | When you collect gold you are collecting money (or doing money collection).

This is the reading you learned with the kanji.
994 | 電鉄 | でんてつ | Electric Railway |  | The electricity iron sounds scary, but if you think to back in the day and to where iron was used a lot, you probably think of the railway systems... big hunky pieces of iron on the ground to make the railway.

It's your expression. \n The readings are both kun'yomi, but they're the readings you've already learned when you learned the kanji.
999 | 目医者 | めいしゃ | Eye Doctor | Oculist\n Ophthalmologist | Do you remember 医者 (doctor)? What happens when you add eye on there? You have yourself an eye doctor. \n The reading is just the vocab word 医者 (いしゃ) plus the reading 目 (め), the same as the reading you learned with the kanji.
1000 | 顔 | かお | Face |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is kun'yomi, since it's a kanji all alone with nothing attached. Luckily, that's also the reading you've already learned, so associate that with this vocab word.
1001 | 農場 | のうじょう | Farm |  | The place you do your farming is a farm! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

You get the "France Language" aka the French Language. \n The reading is just the on'yomi reading for 語 which is the reading you learned with the kanji. This is probably because it gets added onto a lot of other words so it's treated like a jukugo. For example: 日本語 = "Japanese Language." 中国語 = "Chinese Language." スペイン語 = "Spanish Language."
1005 | 青葉 | あおば | Fresh Leaves | Greenery\n Young Leaves | A young leaf is exactly what you'd expect, although most people usually just call them fresh leaves. \n The readings for the kanji in this word are the kun'yomi readings. Since you've already seen the word 青, hopefully you can just combine it with 葉 (you learned the reading for this part with the kanji). Be sure to pay attention to the rendaku, though. は goes to ば in this word, making it あおば.
1006 | 大学院 | だいがくいん | Graduate School | Grad School | Remember how you learned that 大学 means "college?" Well the institution you go to after college is graduate school! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

1008 | 重い | おもい | Heavy |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of heavy? It's also heavy. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou're lifting something that's really heavy. Oof! You lift it above your head. You're so awesome. You scream: "OH! MORE!" (おも) they put more. You yell it again: "OH, MORE!" and again: "OH, MORE!"

1009 | 病院 | びょういん | Hospital |  | A sick institution is a place where sick people go. That is a hospital. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

Gross, your family is.
1014 | 日本語 | にほんご | Japanese Language | Japanese | You know 日本 is "Japan." So, when you add language onto the end of that you have Japanese language. \n The reading is just the vocab word 日本 (にほん) plus the on'yomi that you learned for 語. Combine them together to get the reading for this word.
1015 | 日本酒 | にほんしゅ | Japanese Style Alcohol | Japanese Alcohol\n Sake | You know that 日本 is "Japan" so when you add alcohol onto the end of that you have Japanese Style Alcohol (what's the big Japanese style alcohol that everyone knows?

That was a single guillotine. Now they are going to try two guillotines (つぎ) and see how that works on your thick neck. NEXXXXT!

The people there keep shouting "Next! Next!" because items come in succession without stopping! \n The reading is the same as the word 次 (so it's つぎ), but this time you do it twice. No strange rendaku or anything like that either, which makes everyone happier.

Together with one and place, it makes this one place or one spot.\nJust like 〜ヶ月, you'll also run into this being written as 一箇所, 一か所, or 一カ所. \n Just like before, the little ヶ is actually read as か. The rest uses the on'yomi you already learned with the kanji. Just watch out 一 here is いっ instead of いち as it makes it easier to pronounce the whole word. Now, read it aloud and try yourself!

What did you do at school today? I beat up this kid. "Oh yah?"

1048 | 読み方 | よみかた | Reading | Pronunciation\n Way Of Reading | You know that this has something to do with reading and you know that 方 means way or method. So, when you think of a "way of reading" you can think of a couple other better words, such as reading (aka the reading of a word) or pronunciation. Anytime you need to know how something sounds, this is what you'll ask for. \n This uses the kun'yomi readings from the vocab words 読む and 方. So as long as you're okay with those, you can apply that knowledge over here.
1049 | 最近 | さいきん | Recent | Latest\n Lately\n Recently | The most nearby is something that happened close to now. It happened recently. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1050 | 研究所 | けんきゅうしょ | Research Institute | Research Facility | You've seen that 研究 is "research" from previous vocab, and you might remember 所 can mean "facility." So this word means research institute or, of course, research facility. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will also help if you know the reading of 研究 already.\nAlso note that 所 is normal in first reading, but gets rendaku'd in the second reading, meaning しょ becomes じょ. Both readings are valid and they don't affect the meaning, so it just comes down to personal preference!
1051 | 回転 | かいてん | Revolve | Rotate\n Rotation | You revolve X number of times. Really, the times isn't so important, but the revolving is. That's why this word is revolve or rotate. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. P.S. Ever heard of "回転ずし?" That's the kind of sushi that's on conveyer belts, rotating around and around, bringing you delicious plates of things.
1052 | お酒 | おさけ | Sake | Alcohol | This is just the noun version of the kanji 酒 - it has an お there to be nice. This word can mean both alcohol (like the parent kanji) or sake (the main kind of Japanese alcohol, at least back in the kanji days). \n The reading is kun'yomi, which isn't what you learned with the kanji. But, it should be pretty easy. You know what Japanese alcohol is called already, right? It's さけ, simple as that. So long as you've heard of sake you should be A-Okay with this reading.
1053 | サービス | サービス | Service | Freebie\n Giving A Freebie | This is the equivalent of the English word service. By extension, it's often used to mean a freebie. Though it's generally used as a standard noun, it can also be a verbal noun used with する. In this case, it means giving a freebie.
1054 | 近道 | ちかみち | Shortcut | Short Way | Taking the nearby road will get you to your destination more quickly (because it's more close by!). This is a shortcut, aka the short way. \n The reading is a bit weird in this one. It uses the kun'yomi reading for both kanji, even though it looks just like it should be all on'yomi reading. It's like you're taking a shortcut with your kanji readings and doing the native Japanese readings (kun'yomi) instead of the more intellectual Chinese ones (on'yomi). Luckily, you've hopefully seen both of these kanji as vocab already. You have ちか for 近 (short for 近い) and you have 道 (みち), just like the word "street" you learned before. Combine these together and you have the reading for this word. Perhaps it's like this because you're combining a couple concepts together into one word, at least when it comes to "short + way."
1055 | 病気 | びょうき | Sick | Illness\n Sickness\n Disease | When your energy is that of sickness, you are probably sick. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1056 | 病人 | びょうにん | Sick Person | Patient | A person who is sick is a sick person. They are also a patient, at least we can hope they are, for their sake. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nEvery sick person enjoys playing on their Nintendo (にん). You have the nastiest flu, but you've still got your Nintendo, so everything is fine.
1057 | 横 | よこ | Side | Beside\n Next To\n Horizontal | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Please note that this word refers to "the side of something." Not "the left side," for example. That would be 左側. \n The reading for this vocab is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, lucky you!
1058 | 歌手 | かしゅ | Singer |  | Remember how  手 can sometimes mean “doer”? What do you think a song doer is? A singer, of course \n The readings are on'yomi readings. You've learned them both already (you learned 手's on'yomi reading with word 投手), so you should be able to read this like a singer sings with a bunch of cashews かしゅ in their mouth. FAST AND LOUD!
1059 | 歌 | うた | Song |  | One of the kanji's meanings is song and this word means exactly that: a song. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThink about a song... but not just any song... think about the utter (うた) song, and make it up right now and sing it out loud. What does the utter song sound like? Why do you love utterances so much that you made a song about them?
1060 | スペイン語 | すぺいんご | Spanish Language | Spanish | You can probably figure out that スペイン is "Spain" just by reading it. Add the kanji language on there and you have the Spanish language (or just Spanish), if you'd like. \n The reading for the kanji portion is just the reading you learned with the kanji. Since it's attached to something, it's like a jukugo word.
1061 | 速度 | そくど | Speed |  | Your fastness degree is your speed.\nYou use 速度 to talk about a specific speed of something like a car or a train. If you want to talk about speed more casually, you can just say スピード or 速さ. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1062 | 立ち飲み | たちのみ | Standing And Drinking | Drinking While Standing | The meaning is the same as the kanji. When you stand and drink, you're standing and drinking. Or indeed, drinking while standing. \n The readings are from the words 立つ and 飲む put together.
1063 | 開始 | かいし | Start | Beginning\n Opening | The open of the start is the start or beginning.\nNote that 開始 is slightly more formal than 始める. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1064 | 話 | はなし | Story | Talk\n Speech\n Conversation | The kanji version of 話 means talk. This word also means talk, but it means a few other things as well. This can refer to a speech or story as well. Basically anything that involves a talking session. So, before you go, I hope you stay awhile and listen to my 話. \n Who tells a great story? Hana, she (はなし) tells a great story! If you know someone named Hana or Hanna you can use that person to help you to remember this one better too.\nYou can also use 話す's reading to help you to remember this one, as well.
1065 | 鉄人 | てつじん | Strong Man | Badass\n Iron Man\n Macho Man\n Tough Guy | A man made of iron is a strong man... aka a huge badass. Have you seen "Iron Chef?" The Japanese translation is 料理の鉄人, which means "Chef Iron Man" aka "Chef Badass," at least in my book. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nCheck out the strong man wearing nothing but jeans (じん). He looks like a badass in his jeans, flexing his pecs. Very impressive, but also slightly terrifying.
1066 | 主語 | しゅご | Subject |  | The main thing you talk about in your language becomes the subject of the sentence. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1067 | 引き算 | ひきざん | Subtraction |  | Remember how 引く means "to subtract?" Add calculate to that and you'll have subtraction! It's the type of calculation you're doing when you subtract. \n This is the kun'yomi reading for 引 and the on'yomi for 算. And the さん reading is rendaku'd into ざん. This is the same for all the math-ish words (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), so try to remember that, because you'll see it again!
1068 | 地下鉄 | ちかてつ | Subway | The Underground\n The Tube\n The Metro | The ground below iron is iron under the ground. It isn't a deposit of iron, though. It's man-made. And what's made of iron? Trains. In this case, because it's underground, it's a subway. Depending on where you live, you might call it the Underground, the Tube, or the Metro \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1069 | 最高 | さいこう | The Best | Best\n Supreme | The most tall isn't literally the most tall. When you think of something high above the rest, you think of something that is the best. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1070 | 最も | もっとも | The Most | Most\n Extremely | This is the adverb version of the kanji, so it has the same meaning, basically. You can say this is the most or just most. You can also use it as extremely. \n The reading for this is a reading you didn't learn with the kanji (the kun'yomi reading). To learn it, let's look at a mnemonic.\nThink of the most ridiculous motto (もっと) you've ever heard. Now imagine a motto that's even more ridiculous. Here are some actual totally real mottos that are the most ridiculous: "What Can Brown Do for You?" "It's Not for Women" "If It Doesn't Get All Over the Place, It Doesn't Belong in Your Face" and of course, "Why Not Enjoy the Go?"
1071 | 今朝 | けさ | This Morning |  | Now morning is just another way of saying this morning. It's the closest morning to right now! \n This reading is an exception. Let's use this mnemonic to remember it:\nThis morning you want a quesadilla (けさ) for breakfast. You can't wait until tomorrow morning, you NEED it this morning! Imagine eating a delicious quesadilla first thing this morning. Mmm!
1072 | 進む | すすむ | To Advance | To Go Forward\n To Progress | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means advance so the verb vocab version means to advance.\nThis is an intransitive verb, meaning that it is about something or someone advancing forward. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nIn order to advance, you must sue Sue for her misdeeds against you. Imagine her standing in your way, literally. She keeps saying, "You'll have to sue me if you want to get past me!" So you do. You sue Sue. Now tell her to move (む).
1073 | タバコ | タバコ | Tobacco | Cigarette | タバコ is the Japanese version of the Portuguese word "tabaco." You probably won’t be shocked to learn that タバコ means tobacco or cigarette in English!\nWatch out for the first syllable, which is タ and not ト. タバコ can also be written in hiragana, and even in kanji, but katakana is the most common by far.
1074 | 決まる | きまる | To Be Decided | To Be Settled | You've seen the word 決める before, hopefully. This is similar, except for instead of doing the action of deciding, something has just been decided (by something or someone else). You are not the decision maker, here. That's why this word is to be decided. \n The reading is the same as 決める, so make sure you know that word so you can apply that knowledge over here.
1075 | 始める | はじめる | To Begin Something | To Start Something\n To Begin \n To Start | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means begin or start, and the verb version is to begin, to begin something, to start, or to start something.\nThis is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You start something. Like studying! You should have started studying earlier though, huh? \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nRight now it's time to begin Haj (はじ). (Haj is the fifth pillar of Islam, and is a pilgrimage to Mecca during the month of Dhu al-Hijja). You need to start Haj right now!
1076 | 助かる | たすかる | To Be Helped | To Be Saved\n To Be Rescued | You know that 助ける means "to help" and this is related. This is when someone is being helped, and we're focusing on the person being helped, rather than the person doing the helping. In grammatical terms, this verb is intransitive, so there is no object. The かる ending is a hint, because verbs with かる as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.\nIt also can be used to talk about how you were rescued, which is like being helped, right? If you want to memorize it that way, that's fine too. \n The reading is the same as 助ける, so hopefully you know that word and can apply that knowledge over here.
1077 | 点く | つく | To Be Lit | To Be Ignited\n To Be On\n To Come On | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji 点 means point, but this verb actually means to be lit or to be ignited. Think of it this way, when a flashlight turns on, it points a beam, of light.\nYou already learned 点ける, which is for when you turn something on. 点く, on the other hand, is an intransitive verb. That means it happens by itself. Like, "Oh look! The lights came on! That's cool (く)!" \n You already learned this reading when you learned 点ける but here's a mnemonic just in case:\nEvery time you count to two (つ) a light comes on. How cool (く) that it does it all by itself!!
1078 | 映る | うつる | To Be Reflected | To Be Projected | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means reflect. The verb vocab version means to be reflected. You're not doing the reflecting directly. You can remember this by thinking how rude (る) it is that someone's reflecting your image using a mirror for everyone outside the dressing room to see. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYour reflection is getting reflected onto the mirror. You don't like it, it doesn't look like you. Impostor reflection! You take a hammer and you 打つ (うつ) it as hard as you can, glass flying everywhere. Then some dubstep starts playing from the broken mirror: うつうつうつうつ.\nYou might recall that this reading is the same as 写る and might wonder if they're related. They are! They both talk about the image of something showing up somewhere else, and use different kanji to distinguish where. In 写る's case, that would typically be in photographs, and for 映る, it's in reflections or projections (which includes the contents of screens, like those of TVs or computers).

You can't miss any games so you just happen to fall ill whenever they're playing so you can stay home and watch. That's pretty convenient, isn't it?
1080 | 売れる | うれる | To Be Sold | To Sell | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

1081 | 化かす | ばかす | To Bewitch | To Enchant | You've seen the word 化ける (to transform) before. Now we have a similar word. This word means to bewitch because when you cuss (かす) you are saying a magic word and bewitching the person in front of you. Imagine yourself yelling out cuss words, and every time a new enchantment falls upon your victim.\nThis verb is transitive, meaning it takes a direct object. You bewitch someone or something. \n The reading is the same as 化ける, so make sure you know that word and you'll be able to learn this word's reading as well.

Now you're starting to collect something.

1086 | 運転する | うんてんする | To Drive |  | A thing that carries rotations (think wheels!) is most kinds of vehicles. So, it's kind of like saying you're "doing vehicles" here... but that doesn't make sense. What do you do to vehicles though? You drive them. That's why this word means to drive. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

1088 | 楽しむ | たのしむ | To Enjoy Something | To Have Fun | You've hopefully seen the word 楽しい, which means "fun." This is basically the verb version (ends in an う sound, right?) of that.

This particular one is transitive, meaning there is a direct object. The action is done to someone or something. So this means to give someone a ride when it's used for people, and to place something on, or to load something when it's used for things.\nUse the せ as a hint. The せ is a "sail" (せ) that you use on your boat to give someone a ride. How nice of you. \n The reading is kun'yomi (see that hiragana?) but that's the reading you learned with the kanji so you should be okay with this.

The 出 portion may be confusing, but you can usually assume that if one part of the word is kun'yomi / vocab reading, the other part is too, which is why 出 uses the vocab reading.\nOh by the way, this word can be written like this too: 出合う. It’s not as common, but you may come across it every now and then, so it’s good to know!
1098 | 口調 | くちょう | Tone | Tone Of Voice\n Verbal Expression | When your mouth makes tones we call it your tone or tone of voice. They're different kinds of sounds you make with your mouth that make you sound happy, sad, mean, etc. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji.

So, you replace it with another egg (or substitute it with another egg, or exchange it with another egg, etc).\nThis verb is transitive, meaning it has a direct object. You replace something, like that egg! \n The reading for this one is the same as 代わる which you learned in a previous level. As long as you know that one you should be able to learn this one's reading as well.
1102 | 転がる | ころがる | To Roll | To Tumble\n To Lie Down\n To Be Scattered About | You know that the kanji here means revolve. The verb version of this is similar. It means to roll or to tumble. When something is doing these things it is revolving, right? \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhat should you do when you want to roll down a hill? Become a bottle of Corona (ころ). Just imagine yourself as a bottle of Corona, rolling down a hill. You're a Corona bottle, so you roll super easily. Now feel the grass under your glass as you roll down that hill. Nice, isn't it?
1103 | 語る | かたる | To Talk | To Tell\n To Recite | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means language, so when you do language you're going to talk about something. Maybe you're going to tell a story, or the truth.\nThis verb is transitive, so it generally takes a direct object in Japanese, even though the English translations might not. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nSometimes when you're trying to talk about something, there will be that one person who always cuts you off to tell their own story. We call them language cutters (かた). They cut you off and make everyone pay attention to what they're saying. Don't be a language cutter.
1104 | 投げ付ける | なげつける | To Throw Against | To Throw At | You know that you're throwing something that is attaching to something else. How else can you say that? The best way would be to say to throw against or to throw at. \n The readings just come from two vocab words you've hopefully seen already: 投げる and 付ける. So long as you know the readings for those words, the reading for this word should be no problem for you.
1105 | 起きる | おきる | To Wake Up | To Get Up\n To Occur | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means wake up so the verb vocab version is to wake up or to get up.\nThis word also has a secondary meaning of to occur. Think of it this way: when an action "wakes up", in a way it is occurring as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, so tomorrow when you wake up you hopefully won't have to relearn this vocab's reading.
1106 | 求める | もとめる | To Want Something | To Request Something\n To Demand Something | What's the verb form of request? It's to request. It also is for when you want something (to want something), because if you're going to request something, you probably want it. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What is it that you want? You want a moat (もと) around your home. Your neighbor's cats keep pooping on your lawn, but if you had a moat they wouldn't be able to get to your lawn in the first place, since cats hate water (and alligators). You request a moat!
1107 | 役場 | やくば | Town Hall | Town Office\n Public Office | A service location is a place that people go when they're in need of a service. The best place for this is the town hall. Everyone goes to this one location to voice their complaints, and in return their needs are serviced by the officials in the town hall.\n役場 specifically refers to the administrative office of a town (町) or village (村) rather than a city (市). Depending on the location, it may be also be called a 町役場 or 村役場. \n This word uses the on'yomi reading for the first kanji and the kun'yomi reading for the second kanji. That's all you have to remember, though, because you've seen both of these readings before!
1108 | 転送 | てんそう | Transfer | Forwarding | You revolve something, making it roll, and then send it off somewhere. This means you’re transferring or forwarding it to someone else.\n転送 is often used in the context of logistics or communication systems, like transferring packages or forwarding e-mails. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1109 | 思わず | おもわず | Unintentionally | Reflexively\n Spontaneously\n Involuntarily | This is a negative form of the verb 思う which is used as an adverb. If you do something without thinking, you do it unintentionally. As an adverb, you can put this in front of things to say that you did them involuntarily. \n The reading for this is the kun'yomi reading which you learned already, so you should be able to read this word as well.
1110 | とても | とても | Very |  | Look at this totem, oh (とても)! It's very, very, very, very lucky, as all totems should be.\nThis word has a slightly formal feel to it, and you’ll come across it most in writing.
1111 | 作業 | さぎょう | Work | Task\n Operation | If you want to make a business successful you need to be prepared to do a lot of work. Be ready to handle many tasks and operations!\n作業 often focuses on individual, hands-on tasks that are undertaken to accomplish a specific objective. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 作 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nYou love the work involved in sawing gyoza (さぎょう). There's something about taking a piece of gyoza and sawing right through it that you just love so much.
1112 | 入所 | にゅうしょ | Admission | Entrance\n Imprisonment\n Internment | You enter a facility. So this is your admission or entrance into that facility.\n入所 is for entering facilities or institutions, often those with names ending in 所, like a 研究所 (research institute).

1114 | 味方 | みかた | Ally | Supporter\n Friend | The flavor of this direction is one I'd like to follow and go in, along with you. You have a good flavor and you're going in a good direction. Will you be my ally? I'll be your supporter. \n This word uses the on'yomi reading for 味 and the kun'yomi reading for 方. Luckily, you've learned them both already so you should be able to read this word!
1115 | 売り上げ | うりあげ | Amount Sold | Sales\n Proceeds | The selling that you've raised (上げ) is the amount sold or number of sales. Think of a graph going upward, where it's rising as you sell more things. \n The reading for 売 is the one you learned with 売る. The reading for 上げ is the same as the reading for 上げる, a word you learned previously. If you know those two separate things, you should be able to combine them into one awesome vocab thing.
1116 | 不良 | ふりょう | Bad | Substandard\n Delinquent | Something that's not good is bad or substandard. This usage is more formal and frequently paired with other kanji compounds. Alternatively, it can refer to someone who is a  delinquent, in which case it is often used as a standalone word. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1117 | 初歩 | しょほ | Basics | Rudiments\n Elements\n ABCs | The first thing you walk through when you learn something new will always be the basics. You never start by running, you always have to start slow and work your way through the ABCs before you start to run. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1118 | 戦い | たたかい | Battle | Fight\n Conflict | Don't let this word confuse you. It may end in い, but it's not an adjective, it's a noun. There are no rules in war, after all. This word describes what happens in war. Those things are battles, fights, and conflicts. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nIn a fierce battle, there's always a lot of collateral damage. One of the things that gets destroyed is your car. But you can't do anything about it, it's battle time! So you wave goodbye to your car saying, "Ta-ta car (たたか)!" as you punch some jerk in the face.
1119 | 戦場 | せんじょう | Battlefield | Battleground | A war location is the battlefield. That's where the wars are fought, anyways. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1120 | 予め | あらかじめ | Beforehand | In Advance\n Previously\n Ahead Of Time | The kanji and the word are almost exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhat did you do beforehand? You had a raw casual (あらかじ) encounter with a raw Cage, Nic Cage. You probably should have planned something better ahead of time.
1121 | 初級 | しょきゅう | Beginner Level | Elementary Level\n Beginning Level | The first rank of something is the beginner level. Compare this to 中級 and 上級 (vocab from this level) to get a fuller understanding. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

1124 | 乗り場 | のりば | Bus Stop | Taxi Stand\n Train Platform\n Boarding Area | You've seen the word 乗る by now, hopefully, and know it means "to ride." So this word has to do with a "riding location." Where do you go to get a ride somewhere? Most likely, it's a bus stop or taxi stand. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings, which you've learned already. Also, use 乗る to help you to remember the reading for 乗り.
1125 | 注意 | ちゅうい | Caution | Attention\n Warning | When you pour your ideas into something, you're thinking a lot about it. You're paying close attention and using caution. You'll see this on a lot of warning signs marking dangerous things in Japan, so be sure to pay attention to them! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1126 | 洋服 | ようふく | Clothes | Western Clothing\n Western Style Clothes | Western style clothes is just Western clothing (or Western style clothes). But nowadays, because Japanese people wear Western clothing all the time, we use it to just mean clothes.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

1128 | 仲間 | なかま | Companion | Comrade\n Associate | Your relationship intervals... this doesn't make much sense at first, but if you think about it, at certain intervals from within your friends, you'll run into someone who's your companion... not just any old friend. Something better. Something part of your group. \n The reading for 仲 is the one you learned. When you learned the kanji 間, we didn't give you a mnemonic for the (ま) reading, so here's one now:\nThink through all your companions in your life. Imagine one of them is your Ma (ま). She's on your pirate crew, and a pretty awesome pirate.
1129 | 競争 | きょうそう | Competition |  | When you compete to the point of conflict, you know that this person / entity is your competition. Gotta beat out that competition. For example, in order to beat out the competition, WaniKani has a mascot that can eat every other small furry animal that the competition has for their mascot. Case closed. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1130 | 便利 | べんり | Convenient | Handy\n Useful | When you profit from your convenience, that means you have something very convenient or handy. Remember, you can profit in other ways besides money.

1133 | 別 | べつ | Different | Separate | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
1134 | 別人 | べつじん | Different Person | Changed Person\n Changed Man | A separate person is someone who is different from who they were before. I saw you a year ago and you were someone else.

It'll also help if you know the two separate words that make up this longer word.
1137 | 特に | とくに | Especially | Particularly | Something is towards (に) special. That thing is especially special, wouldn't you say? \n The reading is the same reading you learned for this kanji.
1138 | 運命 | うんめい | Fate | Destiny | Everyone has to carry their fate. So what is the thing you're carrying? It's your fate. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1139 | 気持ち | きもち | Feeling |  | The energy you hold in your body is your feelings. It can take the form of all kinds of things. Good feelings, bad feelings, that "strange feeling." \n 気 is on'yomi and you learned that with the kanji. 持ち, though, is kun'yomi, which you learned with the word 持つ. One of those weird exception readings, but the ち on the end of 持ち is a clue that it uses the kun'yomi.
1140 | 心持ち | こころもち | Feeling | Mood\n Somewhat\n Slightly | Your heart holds a lot of feelings. They can be overwhelming and sometimes it feels like there are none in there at all, but that doesn't mean they aren't there in your heart. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You learned them when you learned the words 心 and 持つ, so you should be able to read this on your own.
1141 | 指 | ゆび | Finger | Toe | The kanji and the word are almost exactly the same. The only difference is that this word can mean finger or toe. What are toes but small, walking fingers? \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember:\nWhat do you use your finger for the most? For pointing, of course! Imagine going up to people and saying, "What will you be (ゆび) when you grow up?" Point your finger at the next person, "What will you be?" Keep going until you're just saying, "You be?

1142 | 一位 | いちい | First Place | First Rank | When you are number one in rank, you're in first place. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

Haven’t you ever heard the phrase, “neck and neck” when two people in a race are both super close to first place? Just remember that and you’ll never forget this word. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You learned this reading for 首 when you learned 部首, and the reading for 位 is the one you learned with the kanji, so you should be able to read this on your own.
1144 | 昔話 | むかしばなし | Folk Tale | Legend\n Old Story\n Folklore | Long ago people used to talk about all sorts of things. Most of them weren't true. Long ago people liked to lie a lot. Now we call those things they talked about folk tales and legends. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You learned them both already, so you should be able to read this on your own. Just watch out for the rendaku of はなし to ばなし.
1145 | 食べ物 | たべもの | Food |  | An eat thing (aka "a thing you eat") is food. Eat those things. Eat that food. Because it's a "thing" you know it's a noun. Interesting how this kanji can turn a verb like this into a noun, right? Look out for it because this pattern will show up with other verbs as well! \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, but you know them both now, so you should be able to read this too!
1146 | 友好 | ゆうこう | Friendship |  | If you have a friend you like, well, that's true friendship! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1147 | 仕返し | しかえし | Getting Even | Getting Back At\n Retaliation\n Revenge | When you return the doings of another person, you're doing it to get even (whether it's a nice thing or a mean thing). \n The readings are a bit weird, here. 仕 gets its on'yomi reading... you should be okay with that. 返し gets the kun'yomi reading, though, which is the reading you saw with the word 返す in level 9. You can tell this part uses the kun'yomi vocab reading because it has that hiragana attached to it. Just remember to distinguish between the two parts of the word to remember the readings.
1148 | 神 | かみ | God | Gods | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nDo you know the word "Kamikaze"? Also, do you remember the word 風 from a previous level? Kamikaze means "divine winds" or "godly winds." If you know the word "Kamikaze" you can apply it to this single word, that means "god" or "gods." Use your prior knowledge to remember this reading.
1149 | 良い | よい | Good |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of good? It's also good. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember:\nA good way to pass the time is with a yo-yo (よ). But it better be a good yo-yo. A bad one will just fall apart.
1150 | 気持ちいい | きもちいい | Good Feeling | Feeling Good\n Feels Good | When you have a "feeling" (気持ち) that is いい (that means "good" by the way), you have a good feeling. \n The reading comes from the vocab word 気持ち, so if you know that (or the vocab words 気 and 持ち) you should be A-okay on this one. Maybe even feeling good about it?
1151 | 努力 | どりょく | Great Effort | Exertion\n Grueling Effort | You toil and use your strength. Ugh! How difficult. You really put in a great effort. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1152 | 苦労 | くろう | Hardship | Troubles | Suffering and labor. Sounds like the kind of thing these soft hands wouldn't want to deal with. These are hardships and troubles. Hopefully you don't have too much of this with kanji anymore! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1153 | 苦手 | にがて | Hard To Deal With | Weak Point\n Poor At\n Not Very Good At\n Bad At | A "suffering hand" is a little misleading. Think more in terms of the words 苦い (bitter) and 手 (person... remember how that happens sometimes?). Now think of this word like you're bitter about having to work with someone. Why? Because they are extremely hard to deal with. \n The reading is that of 苦い (にがい) plus regular old 手 (て). Remember, this is your bitter person, the person who's "hard to deal with." So, it uses the strange にがい reading.
1154 | 高級 | こうきゅう | High-Class | High Grade\n High Level | A tall grade item is really just a high grade or high-class item. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1155 | 平仮名 | ひらがな | Hiragana |  | Remember how you learned that 仮名 means "kana?" Well this is flat kana. Flat kana is just hiragana. \n You should know the reading for this word because it's the same as the English meaning.
1156 | 使い方 | つかいかた | How To Use | Way Of Using | You've seen the word 使う hopefully by now. If you have, you know it means "to use." So, the way to use something is the way of using (aka how to use). This will be a word you see when you're looking at directions for how to use something. \n This uses the kun'yomi readings from the vocab words 使う and 方. So as long as you're okay with those, you can apply that knowledge over here.
1157 | 〜付き | つき | Including | Included\n Furnished With\n Attached To | You know that the kanji 付 means attach and words like 付く mean "to be attached." This has the same idea. When you see this attached to another word, for example, you might know that something is attached to something else, or perhaps included with it. For example, if you stay at a hotel room, maybe it is a breakfast付き, i.e. "including breakfast." \n The reading comes from the reading of the kanji as well as from words like 付く and 付ける.
1158 | 不便 | ふべん | Inconvenient | Not Convenient | Something that is not convenience is inconvenient. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1159 | 中級 | ちゅうきゅう | Intermediate Level | Intermediate Rank\n Intermediate Grade | Something at the middle rank or grade is at an intermediate level. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1160 | 始めに | はじめに | In The Beginning | To Begin With\n To Start With | Remember how 始める means "to begin something"? 始め is its noun version and means "beginning," as in the start of an action or process. に marks a point in time. So 始めに means in the beginning.\n始めに can also mean to begin with or to start with when introducing an opening action, like 始めに、ウォーミングアップをしましょう (let's begin with some warm-up exercises). \n The reading is kun'yomi (look at all that hiragana!) but that's the reading you learned with the word 始める, so have no fear, you got it!
1161 | 仕事 | しごと | Job | Work\n Occupation | You know 事 means "occurrence," but it can also mean "thing." So when you're doing things all day, what are you probably doing? A job! All jobs really just amount to doing things. \n This word uses the on'yomi reading for 仕 and the kun'yomi reading for 事. Please note that 事 uses the reading こと, which you didn't learn with the kanji, but you have come across it once or twice by now, and because of the way rendaku works, it's changed to the voiced ごと.
1162 | 丁度いい | ちょうどいい | Just Right | Exactly Right | If 丁度 is "exactly", then "exactly good" is going to be just the right amount, aka just right. \n If you know the reading for 丁度 you'll know the reading for this too. Your knowledge should be just right, as they say inside my head.
1163 | 労働者 | ろうどうしゃ | Laborer | Blue Collar Worker\n Manual Laborer | Someone who does labor for work is a laborer. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1164 | 命 | いのち | Life |  | A vocab made from a single kanji all alone usually keeps at least one of the meanings of its kanji parent. In this case, that's life. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThe Book of Enoch (いのち) has passed down your fate and told you how to use your life. You must read the book of Enoch and find out what you're supposed to do.
1165 | 好き | すき | Like | Love\n Likable\n Lovable | You know that 好 means like and this vocab word means the same thing: like or love!\nThis word is an adjective in Japanese, so a more literal translation is likable or lovable. Still, it usually sounds more natural to translate it as a verb in English. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWho do you like more than anyone? Your friend Sue. If you know someone named Sue, pretend you like her. If you don't, think of a famous person you know named Sue and use her, pretending you're good friends that like each other a lot.
1166 | 文字通り | もじどおり | Literal | Literally\n To The Letter | Remember how you learned the words 文字 and 通り? Well an "avenue" made of "letters" is literally to the letter. Wink. \n This is a combination of the words 文字 and 通り, which you learned already, so you should be able to read this one. Just make sure you remember that とおり becomes どおり because of rendaku.
1167 | 昔 | むかし | Long Ago | Long Time Ago | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is a good way to start stories, by the way: 昔々に… (Long, long ago). \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. むかし sounds like a kun'yomi reading, doesn't it? It's so long.
1168 | 負け犬 | まけいぬ | Loser |  | You've hopefully come across 負ける by now, which means "to lose." So, you can figure out this word means "losing dog." Well, calling someone a dog isn't so nice, so you're probably just calling them a loser. \n The readings are kun'yomi, but you should be familiar with 負ける and of course 犬 well enough to learn the reading here.
1169 | 低い | ひくい | Low | Short | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of low? It's low. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou look down and very low to the ground is a man, looking up at you. Your friend is there too, but you don't know this little man. Your friend says "He coo', he coo," referring to the low to the ground man.
1170 | 労働 | ろうどう | Manual Labor | Labor\n Work | The labor work is when you're doing work with your body, right? That's manual labor. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1171 | 意味 | いみ | Meaning |  | The flavor of an idea, what is that? Imagine yourself licking an idea to figure out what it tastes like. What do you think you'll be tasting? Probably the meaning of said idea. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1172 | 新た | あらた | New | Fresh\n Novel\n Newly\n Freshly | This is the adverb version of the kanji new, so it means new too. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYour parents put a newly wrapped present under the Christmas tree. You don't want to wait to see what new thing they got you so you rip it open to find they got you a raw (あら) steak. Getting a new steak is cool and all, but a raw steak is pretty gross. It's dripping blood all over the place.
1173 | 別に | べつに | Not Particularly | Not Really\n Separately\n In Addition To | If someone asks if you want a separate knee (に), you'll say not particularly. I mean, you've never thought about it, but do you really need more knees? Not really...\nIn this first meaning, 別に is often used on its own, or with a negative verb or adjective, as in 別に長くない (not particularly long).\nHowever, when 別に is used with a positive verb, it often simply means separately, or in addition to. After all, when you have to do something separately, you have to do it in addition to something else. Like learning this meaning in addition to the first one. What a chore! \n The reading is just the reading you learned with the kanji. Well done!
1174 | 発売中 | はつばいちゅう | Now For Sale | In Stores Now\n Now Available | You have 発売, which means "for sale," and then you have 中 which is middle. An item that is in the middle of being for sale is now for sale, in stores now or in other words now available. You'll see this for items which have recently been released or when a shopkeeper wants to let you know that they're selling something now, finally, or whatever. \n The reading comes from 発売 and 中 (kanji reading) put together.
1175 | 老人 | ろうじん | Old Person | Elderly Person | An elderly person is an old person (or an elderly person). Don't call a person a 古い人, though. 古い is used for things, not people. Be nice, they're your elders. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nEvery old person has roe jeans(ろうじん), a special pair of jeans smeared with roe that they wear when they go out on the town. Some elderly people have cod roe jeans, some have salmon roe jeans… But tofugu roe jeans (adorned with the roe of the lesser spotted tofugu) are the most fashionable of all.
1176 | 意見 | いけん | Opinion | View | The idea you see in your head is your opinion. As the dude once said... "That's just, like, your 意見, man." \n The reading is all on'yomi, meaning 意 is just fine. 見's on'yomi (けん) is a reading you didn't learn with the kanji because it's so much less useful, but you do have to know it here. You've seen it with 発見 a couple levels ago, so that should help. Still, here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\nIn this case, just think about how Ken the samurai has an opinion on everything. Ken is such a know-it-all, and you're better off agreeing with his opinions. He's a samurai after all!
1177 | 注文 | ちゅうもん | Order | Request | You pour writing onto a form. You're filling out this form to order something new for yourself. It's a formal request to get this new thing (imagine it being something you're excited about ordering right now, and imagine yourself ordering it by pouring writing onto an order form). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1178 | 命令 | めいれい | Order | Command | Your fate orders are the orders you get from above. You are ordered and commanded to carry out said orders. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1179 | 太平洋 | たいへいよう | Pacific Ocean |  | The fat peace ocean is the Pacific Ocean. The Japanese language thinks this ocean is peaceful, just like English does (the word 太平 actually means "peace").\nNote that we're using the alternative meaning of 洋 here! If you didn't learn that with the kanji, just imagine that to get to Western Style places you need to cross the ocean from Japan! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1180 | 用意 | ようい | Preparation | Getting Ready | When you have an idea for a task you are in preparation for actually doing it. Because it's still just an idea you're still getting ready. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1181 | 公共 | こうきょう | Public | Community | When the public comes together you have yourself a nice community made up of the public. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1182 | 〜位 | い | Rank |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the on'yomi reading, which you learned. This is probably because you'll see this word attached to other words, showing the rank of that thing.
1183 | 本物 | ほんもの | Real Thing | Real Deal\n Genuine Article | The real thing is the real thing, aka the real deal.\nIf you learned 本 as book you can also think of this word as the "book thing." What is this book thing? Is it the real version of the book? Is it the real deal? If so, I'll pay you a million. \n The readings are on'yomi plus kun'yomi (kun'yomi is 物). You learned the reading of the kanji 本 and also the vocabulary reading of 物, so you should be able to read it.
1184 | 電波 | でんぱ | Reception | Radio Wave\n Electromagnetic Wave | The electricity wave is a wave of electricity going through the air. There are many words you can use to describe this, but the easiest one is reception (like the reception on your phone, for example).\nOther more technical meanings are radio wave and electromagnetic waves. Which one you like is up to you, but reception is going to be the most common meaning on the street. Luckily people in Japan don't have AT&T, otherwise you'd hear this word a lot more… \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The は from 波 rendakus to ぱ, so be careful. Maybe it's your pa who has bad reception every time you try to call him?
1185 | 受付 | うけつけ | Receptionist | Reception | Imagine someone accepting something and then attaching something. This person is a receptionist, because they are accepting the call, writing down the information, and then attaching said information to a sticky note for you to read. You say, "No, I'm not available." \n For this reading you have to think back to the verb words that get used with this kanji, namely 受ける and 付ける. Then just drop off the るs and put them together. 受 becomes うけ and 付 becomes つけ and you're left with うけつけ. This is what's called a compound word. And now you know it. Nice!
1186 | 仲直り | なかなおり | Reconciliation | Making Peace\n Making Up | A relationship fix is reconciliation, making peace, or making up with someone. \n The readings are the kun'yomi readings. For 仲 you're fine. That's what you learned with the kanji. For 直り think back to the vocab word 直る. That's what's going on here.
1187 | 仲 | なか | Relationship | Relation | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading since it's a single kanji, all alone, but this is the reading you learned with the kanji, so you should be okay and have a great relationship with this word going forward.
1188 | 金持ち | かねもち | Rich Person | Rich\n Wealthy | When you hold gold you are a rich person. \n Do you remember the word お金? This is the 金 in that word. The reading for 持ち is the も you learned with 持つ. So, combine the かね of お金 and the 持ち and you have the reading of this word. Note that just like お金, you'll often see this with the honorific prefix お in front of it as well.
1189 | 屋上 | おくじょう | Rooftop | Housetop | Above the roof is the rooftop. What else would be up there? \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for 屋 though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nOne place in the world has more rooftops than any where else, and that's Oklahoma (おく). They get so many tornadoes that they need extra rooftops for when the first few blow off.
1190 | 海岸 | かいがん | Seashore | Coast\n Seacoast | The ocean/sea coast is the seashore. Then again, it could also be the coast as well. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1191 | 秒 | びょう | Second |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well - that is the unit of time, second. \n The reading is the same as you learned with the kanji. It's presumably because it's usually attached to other things, like numbers, making it act more like a jukugo word would. Anyway, you should only need a second to learn this reading, since you should already know it.
1192 | 安売り | やすうり | Sell Cheaply | Discount\n Bargain Sale\n Sale | When you sell something cheap, you're selling it at a discount. Alternatively you can remember this word as sell cheaply or bargain sale. These are good deals! \n The hiragana on the end hints that the readings are the kun'yomi readings. Use your memory of 安い and 売る to help you to remember how to read this.
1193 | 売り手 | うりて | Seller | Vendor | Remember how 手 can mean “doer”? Here, we have a sell doer. Who might that be? It’s someone who does selling – a seller or vendor.\n売り手 is usually used when talking about sellers versus buyers. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, but you know them both now, so you should be able to read this too! One hint that this is a kun'yomi reading word is the hiragana in the center. It's like two separate words combined together, and when a word is a single kanji / a single kanji with hiragana attached it is usually kun'yomi. This is like two of those, combined.
1194 | 別の | べつの | Separate | Different\n Another\n Separate Thing\n Different Thing\n Another Thing | The の is there to indicate that it is the difference of something. For example this is like saying "the separate ______" or "the different _____" or "another ______". 別 by itself just means separate, different, or another. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned. Move on to a 別の漢字, ok?
1195 | 別々 | べつべつ | Separately | Individually | When you separate separate you're putting things off into their own areas. You're marking them off separately and individually. \n The reading is just the べつ reading you know, twice.
1196 | 共有 | きょうゆう | Shared | Co Ownership\n Joint Ownership\n Share | The things you together have are the things that are shared. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1197 | 神道 | しんとう | Shinto | Shintou | The way/road of the god(s) is, as you can probably guess, a big Japanese religion. There's two, and I'll give you a hint, this one isn't Buddhism (that would probably have the kanji for Buddha in it, no?). So what's the other big one? It's Shinto. If you're having trouble remembering this because you've never heard of it before, skip to the reading. The reading will help. \n The reading is a bit wonky. 神 should be no problem. 道 on the other hand is almost the one you learned (どう) but now it's とう for some reason. Perhaps the gods took away the dakuten to make it とう, who knows. All I know is that it's best not to question said gods. If you already know of Shinto in English, though, this reading should be really easy. If you don't, perhaps you can use this reading to help you to remember Shinto the religion.
1198 | 神社 | じんじゃ | Shinto Shrine |  | A God company... think of this as "what 'company' does the god's work?" Well, the answer to that is a shrine, probably. In this case a Shinto Shrine because of the しん in the 神. \n But wait! 神 is read じん in this word for some reason. Darn them gods, always messing around, adding dakuten. Maybe this will help, though: Imagine yourself at a Shinto Shrine. You are praying to the Gods, asking for food. Out from the sky rains Ginger (じんじゃ). You are pelted with it and not sure if you should be happy or upset.
1199 | 買い物 | かいもの | Shopping |  | You've hopefully seen 買う by now and know it means "to buy." So, 買い is going to be similar to that. Add that to thing and you have a "buying things" sort of word. What does "buying things" describe? It describes shopping. \n The readings are the kun'yomi, which is usually the case when there's hiragana in the middle. You learned the reading for 買い when you learned the kanji, as well as the word 買う, and you learned this reading of 物 in the word 物!
1200 | 辺 | へん | Side |  | One of the kanji meanings is side, and as a standalone word this also means side, as in the sides of a shape. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
1201 | 見物 | けんぶつ | Sightseeing | Sightseer\n Watching | If you try to see a bunch of things at once, you are probably sightseeing or watching. This can also refer to the person doing the action, so it can sometimes mean sightseer too. \n The reading is all on'yomi, and you know how to read 物. 見's on'yomi (けん) is a reading you didn't learn with the kanji because it's so much less useful, but you do have to know it here. You've seen it with 発見 a couple levels ago, so that should help. Just imagine taking the samurai Ken on an epic sightseeing trip. Think of all the things you and Ken will visit!
1202 | 売り切れ | うりきれ | Sold Out | Out Of Stock | When the selling is cut, that means something is sold out. You'll see this word a lot in stores (or, hopefully you won't...) in Japan. Look out for it if you're able! \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, but you know them both now, so you should be able to read this too!
1203 | 時々 | ときどき | Sometimes | At Times | You know the single word 時, right? It means time. This is that twice. So you have one time, and you have another time. They are separate. Things don't happen in every of these times you have. They happen sometimes. \n The reading is the vocab word 時 twice, with the second one getting rendaku'd.
1204 | 特別 | とくべつ | Special |  | Something that is special and separate from the rest is, well, special. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1205 | 見事 | みごと | Splendid | Magnificent\n Beautiful\n Admirable\n Praiseworthy Act | Learner, if you see a thing, then it must be splendid. You saw it, after all, so of course it's magnificent. You only see the beautiful things in this world. And that's an admirable quality. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You learned them already, so you should be able to read this on your own. Just remember that there is rendaku on こと and it becomes ごと.
1206 | 成功 | せいこう | Success |  | When you become achievement, you have probably gained plenty of success. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1207 | 作戦 | さくせん | Tactics | Strategy\n Operation | When you make war, you're building it up like you'd build a building. You have to make strategy, you have to plan, you have to come up with awesome tactics for your operation. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1208 | 物語 | ものがたり | Tale | Story\n Legend | A language about things. This is a confusing one. Just think of it more like someone talking about things, anything, really. Someone who just talks about things is someone who tells stories. So, this word means tale or story or legend (not the Tom Cruise one, though). \n Both kanji take the kun'yomi here. For 物, that's もの, which you learned with the vocabulary 物. You learned the kun'yomi for 語 with the verb 語る, but here it becomes がたり because of rendaku, and the り is tucked inside the kanji.\nMaybe you've already heard the word ものがたり too. It's in some film and book names. If you haven't, and you find this reading hard to remember, think of a story about an infamous Gatling (がたり) gun that wandered the land, mowing everything down in its path. It's a terrible legend, but what if it were true???
1209 | 戦車 | せんしゃ | Tank |  | A war car is probably a little more dangerous than the Honda you drive. No, a war car is a tank. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1210 | 味 | あじ | Taste | Flavor | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou may have the ability to taste things now, but just wait until you get up there in age (あじ). You'll find that the tastes and flavors you once liked will become bland, and you'll need a lot of Sriracha to make things taste better.
1211 | 最初 | さいしょ | The First | First\n Beginning\n Outset | The most first thing is the first thing. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1212 | 初回 | しょかい | The First Time | First Time | The first of something you'll do several or many times is the first time. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1213 | 最低 | さいてい | The Lowest | The Worst\n The Minimum\n Nasty\n Terrible | The most low is the lowest or the minimum. It's also what you call something when you think it's the worst or just plain terrible. Try yelling this out when you're disgusted about someone or something. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1214 | 西洋 | せいよう | The West | Western Countries\n Western | The Western styled West is still known as the West. The one everyone refers to over in Asia when they talk about Western countries in Europe and North America. This is the place you'll hear people say you're from if you live in Canada or something. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1215 | 進める | すすめる | To Advance Something | To Move Something Forward | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means advance, and this verb means to advance something or to move something forward.\nThis is a transitive verb, so you act upon something else. You advance something. You move something forward. Like a school project, or your plans for taking over the world. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help:\nYou are moving your lawsuit forward against Sue. But now she says that YOU'RE the problem. "Sue, sue me," (すすめ) you say as you continue to advance the lawsuit. Make sure to say "me" like "mehh," in a really snobbish way.
1216 | 指定する | していする | To Appoint | To Assign\n To Designate\n To Specify | When you determine and use your finger to point at someone or something, you're going to appoint them. Just imagine yourself determining who's the best for the job then pointing with your finger. That is who you will appoint. The する on the end makes it a verb, so 指定 would be "appointment" or "designation" or something along those lines. Cool how する works. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1217 | 成る | なる | To Become |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means become so the vocab verb version would be to become.\nWhile the kanji version is worth knowing, be aware that you'll usually see this verb written in hiragana. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You are starting to become something else. You're transforming, but you're not sure what it is. First, you get fins... uh oh, something in the water. Then, you gain a tail and rubbery skin... hmm, something sea mammal-like. Oh, and then a huge horn flies out of your nose. You are going to become a narwhal (な).
1218 | 育つ | そだつ | To Be Raised | To Be Brought Up\n To Grow Up | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means raise so the verb vocab version means to be raised.\nP.S. This word is for when you are being raised, not when you are doing the raising of someone. That's 育てる. You'll learn it later. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhen you were raised, you were raised completely on soda (そだ). That's all you drank. No water, no juice... just tons and tons of soda. Imagine this.
1219 | 返る | かえる | To Be Returned | To Return\n To Come Back | You hopefully know the word 返す, which means "to return" (as in, you're doing the direct action of returning something). This word, on the other hand, is the version where something just returns (and you're not doing the action of returning it). Use the る to help you to remember this. る the Kangaroo is returned to you. You don't do any of the returning, it just happens or someone else does it. That's why this word means to be returned.\nNote this word is often combined with くる (to come), which reinforces the aspect that something is coming back to you. \n The reading is the same as 返す, so as long as you know that you'll be able to apply it here to learn the reading of this word as well.
1220 | 放送する | ほうそうする | To Broadcast Something |  | You are going to release and send something out. Imagine this message going out through the sky to everyone around you. You are going to broadcast something to the world!\nThe する is on there to make this noun a verb. Without the する it would be the noun "broadcast." \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1221 | 追う | おう | To Follow | To Chase | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means follow so the verb version is to follow (it's also to chase, because when you follow something you are chasing it too). \n You've learned this reading already, so you should know how to read this word!
1222 | 通う | かよう | To Commute | To Attend\n To Go Back And Forth | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means pass through but we already know the word 通る which means to pass through. This word means a different kind of passing through, like how you pass through the halls of your school everyday. But we don't say to pass through school, we say to attend school, or to commute to school. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use one of the kun'yomi readings. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou live in the middle of three different school districts so you need to decide which of the three schools you want to attend. You decide you don't mind that you have to commute to the farthest of the three because their mascot is Wile E. Coyote (かよ). He's your favorite Looney Toon because he always has the energy to go back and forth after that road runner.
1223 | 比べる | くらべる | To Compare |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means compare so the verb vocab version is to compare. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Look at this cooler (くら). Now look at this other cooler. We need to  compare the two coolers. Think about all the features each one has and really compare, like you have a list or something.
1224 | 争う | あらそう | To Compete | To Argue\n To Quarrel | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means conflict so the vocabulary means to compete, to argue, or to quarrel. Your views conflict with someone else's so you're going to compete with them to see who's right. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou're starting to compete and to argue with someone, who is yelling at you: "You are so (あらそ) stupid!". You might want to imagine this in an accent that gets you closer to the Japanese pronunciation.
1225 | 競う | きそう | To Compete |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means compete so the verb vocab version means to compete. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou really have to compete for key soap (きそ). These days everyone wants their keys as clean as possible, and the special key soap they use is pretty hard to come by. Whenever it's in stock again people try to compete over it. Just imagine all those shoppers fighting over some key soap…
1226 | 集中する | しゅうちゅうする | To Concentrate | To Focus | You collect and focus in on the middle. Really zoom in on it. When you do this, you're concentrating on this spot, thus making the meaning of this word to concentrate or to focus. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1227 | 決定する | けっていする | To Decide | To Determine | A 決定 is a "decision." So, when you add する to it you're making it a verb, meaning this word means to decide. \n The reading is the same as 決定 with する added. Make sure you know 決定 and you'll know this word as well.
1228 | 欠かす | かかす | To Do Without | To Miss An Event\n To Fail To Do | Remember how 欠 means lack? This verb is related. The 欠かす form is a little tricky, but it's sort of like you're causing yourself to lack something. So it means to do without. Depending on the context, it can also mean to miss an event or to fail to do something. Just keep in mind this word is most often used in the negative, like 欠かせないもの (things you can't do without) or 朝のコーヒーは欠かさない (never go without morning coffee).\nYou can remember 欠かす this way: Since you cause yourself to lack something with this word, it's all your fault. That's why you want to cuss (かす). You made yourself miss out on something. Well, $*%!!! \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already so you should be able to read it!
1229 | 便所 | べんじょ | Restroom | Bathroom\n Toilet | *Ahem.* This is the convenience facility. What place above all others should be convenient to get to? You know, just in case? That would be the restroom. You might also call it the bathroom, the toilet, the lavatory, or the facilities.\nThis word is casual and can often sound gruff, so you won't normally see it on official signs or hear it in polite conversation. It's worth knowing so you can understand it in casual speaking and writing though. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just watch out for the rendaku.
1230 | 保持する | ほじする | To Keep | To Hold\n To Maintain\n To Retain | This is the verb version of 保持 (keep), so this means to keep, to hold, or to maintain.\nNote that this is a formal word that's commonly used in professional or official contexts. \n The reading is the same as 保持, so if you know that word's reading, you know this one too.
1231 | 欠く | かく | To Lack Something |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means lack, and this verb means to lack something. Pretty simple in English, but 欠く is actually kind of advanced and formal in Japanese, so it's mostly just used in writing.\nAlso keep in mind this is a transitive verb, so 欠く takes a direct object — maybe someone lacks knowledge, for example, or you lack concentration. This is a bit different from saying "your concentration is lacking," at least grammatically. (For that, you'd use 欠ける.) \n You learned this reading when you learned 欠ける, but here's a mnemonic just in case:\nYou never know when you're going to lack something. Like a car (か). Did you plan for it to break? NO! But it happened and now you lack a car in a big way. Not cool (く)!
1232 | 開放する | かいほうする | To Open Something Up | To Throw Something Open\n To Open Something To The Public | When you open then release, say, a door, you're opening it up for everyone to come in. That's why it means to open something up or to throw something open. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1233 | 拾う | ひろう | To Pick Something Up | To Find Something\n To Gather Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means pick up so the verb vocab version is to pick something up. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Nicely done!
1234 | 指す | さす | To Point | To Point At\n To Indicate\n To Refer To | The kanji means finger. So, if you "to finger" something, what are you doing? You're pointing. That's why this word means to point. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou are pointing at something in fear. It is a saw (さ). Thing is, you're pointing at this saw with a missing finger. It just cut off your finger and you're freaking out, trying to point with a bloody non-finger.
1235 | 注ぐ | そそぐ | To Pour |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means pour so the verb vocab version is to pour. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou are going to pour some sauce (そそ).
1236 | 気付く | きづく | To Realize | To Notice | When you attach your energy (imagine someone suddenly looking up at something, attaching their energy to it), you have noticed or realized something. That's why this word means to realize or to notice.\nDon't confuse this with 気を付けて which is similar in that it has all the same kanji. It's just used a little different. Try to remember the difference before moving on. \n The readings come from the 気 kanji (which you know) and the word 付く which you should know by now. Combine these together and you have the ability to read this word. Take note that the 付く part is rendaku'd, though, so it is a tiny bit different.
1237 | 放す | はなす | To Release | To Let Go\n To Release Something\n To Let Go Of Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means release so the verb vocab version is to release. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Imagine you are going to release something. It is a 花 (はな). You release it from your hand and it falls, hitting the ground in slow motion. You have the power to release and you are doing the releasing (versus 放れる where something is just released). You can remember this because even though you did the releasing of the flower, you're going to sue the pavement company for breaking your flower. It's all a big scam you're running.
1238 | 転がす | ころがす | To Roll Something | To Turn Something Over | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means revolve, and the verb version is when you make something revolve. You roll it. That's why this verb is to roll something.\nThis is a transitive verb. That means you roll something else, like a ball. Or, if you're a dung beetle, poop. 💩 Not to be confused with 転がる, which is intransitive, like so many verbs ending in がる. \n You learned this reading when you learned 転がる, but here's a mnemonic anyway just in case:\nWhen you try to roll something, the outside bits may be moving, but its core (ころ) stays still. Picture yourself making the earth roll across the floor. The outside parts where the people live are spinning round and round, but the earth's core is in exactly the same place.
1239 | 見送る | みおくる | To See Off | To Put Off\n To Pass On | You know the words 見る and 送る by now, hopefully. Here you're "seeing" the "sending." You're seeing someone off, so this verb is to see off. This can also mean to put off or to pass on, since it's as though you're just passively seeing someone (or something) off rather than taking action and going with them. \n The readings come from the vocab words 見る and 送る. Make sure you know those and you'll know this word's reading as well.
1240 | 苦しむ | くるしむ | To Suffer | To Struggle | You've already been introduced to the word 苦しい. That word means painful, or agonizing. So, if you turn that into a verb, you have to suffer or to struggle. \n The reading comes from 苦しい, so as long as you're on top of that word, this word should be readable for you as well.
1241 | 伝える | つたえる | To Transmit | To Tell\n To Pass Down\n To Convey | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means transmit, so the verb version is to transmit or to tell something. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou want to transmit a signal to the stars (つた)! Trying to tell your message to anyone on earth would be too boring and too easy. Aim your message at the nearest star and transmit it into space!
1242 | 試す | ためす | To Try Something Out | To Give Something A Try | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means attempt or try. The verb vocab version is to try something out or to give something a try. Why don't you try out the meaning of this verb, while you're at it? \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Okay. Here's the deal. We have this wild animal. I want you to attempt to tame (ため) it. Now, imagine trying to tame this wild animal. Yeehaw!
1243 | 働く | はたらく | To Work | To Labor\n To Commit | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means work, and the verb version means to work, to labor, and sometimes to commit (a crime). \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: If you are as mad as a hatter you'll need to work very hard to regain your sanity. You know The Hatter from Alice in Wonderland? Imagine how hard he would have to work to be considered "normal".
1244 | 利く | きく | To Work Well | To Be Possible\n To Be Effective | You know the kanji means profit. When you make it into a verb, though, it means to work well. If you think about it, when something works well it makes you a profit. \n What works so well? Your special key (き) that can unlock anyone and anything's potential. Imagine putting it into a key slot in someone's back. Someone who's a good for nothing can't-do-anything is now an effective member of society! Go around using your key on other non-effective things and show them that anything is possible!
1245 | 意外 | いがい | Unexpected | Surprising | Something outside your normal idea of how things work will come as unexpected or surprising to you. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1246 | 乗り物 | のりもの | Vehicle |  | You know that 乗り has something to do with riding and that 物 is a thing. So what is a "riding thing?" Nowadays, at least, that would be a vehicle. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, but you know them both now, so you should be able to read this too!
1247 | 勝ち | かち | Victory | Win\n A Victory\n A Win | You've hopefully seen 勝つ by now, which means "to win." This is a nouny version of that. So, what's the noun version of "to win?" It's a win or a victory. \n The reading comes from 勝つ. So as long as you have some understanding of that reading, you should be able to read this one as well.
1248 | 戦争 | せんそう | War |  | You have war and conflict. Of course, conflict comes with war, so this word just means war. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1249 | 波 | なみ | Wave |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember:\nYou jump on a wave and ride around the world on it. As you ride this wave, it gets bigger and bigger, until it reaches tsunami (なみ) proportions. Imagine looking down from the tsunami at the vast, blue sea all around you. That's quite a wave you're riding.
1250 | 洋食 | ようしょく | Western Food | Western Style Food | The Western eats are Western food. Mmmm, 'dem hamburgers. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1251 | 洋風 | ようふう | Western Style |  | Remember how 風 can mean "style" as in 和風? Well, this is now Western style style, more simply put as Western style. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1252 | 洋室 | ようしつ | Western Style Room |  | A Western style room is a Western style room. We're talking something that's not a tatami mat filled room. Good to know this word if you're staying in hotels or ryokans and prefer not to sleep on a futon, etc. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1253 | 誰 | だれ | Who |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
1254 | 行動 | こうどう | Action | Behavior | When you go to move you're actually making an action. This word can also mean behavior, since your actions are what make up your behavior. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1255 | 活動 | かつどう | Activity |  | The lively moves you make are your activity.\n活動 includes all kinds of activities, including nature activities, club activities, economic activity, and so on! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1256 | 空港 | くうこう | Airport |  | Put aside your steampunk blimp fantasies for a moment. A sky harbor is an airport, nothing more. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1257 | 全員 | ぜんいん | All Members | All Hands\n Everyone\n Everybody | All members means all members. This is also a fancy way to say everybody. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1258 | もう | もう | Already | Soon\n Yet\n Anymore | You've mowed your lawn (もう) already? Wow, you're ahead on your mowing. Good work. You'll have to do it again soon, though.\nThis can also mean yet in a question, and anymore with a negative.
1259 | 動物 | どうぶつ | Animal |  | A moving thing... think about the "things" that move. Technically it could be a lot of things (aka basically anything), but in this case we are talking about moving living things. We won't include humans, because humans are too good to be called things. This refers to animals instead. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1260 | 鳴き声 | なきごえ | Animal Cry | Animal Sound\n Animal Noise\n Chirp\n Tweet\n Roar\n Bark\n Meow | The chirp voice is a sound an animal makes. Sure, it works for birds (which chirp), but it also works with most other animals as well. So, we call this an animal cry. \n The readings are those that you learned with the kanji. 声 gets changed to ごえ, though, so take note of that in your head. Perhaps you can imagine an animal that does a "GOEEEEE" cry.
1261 | 勝手 | かって | As One Pleases | One's Own Convenience\n One's Own Way\n One's Way | The hand (or person, as you know 手 often refers to a person) that wins gets to do as one pleases without regard for anyone else. \n The reading for this is weird. It's all kun'yomi, which luckily you've seen before, but still strange. I guess when you do as one pleases you can read kanji however you want, in this case the kun'yomi readings. Do note that there's a small っ in there before 手, presumably to connect the two readings of the two kanji together.
1262 | 悪い | わるい | Bad | Poor\n Wrong | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of bad? It's also bad. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nDo you know how in the Mario universe all the bad versions are called "WARU" (わる)? For example: "WARUIJI" and "WARIO." That's because they are bad. They come from this kanji. So, if you ever need to remember this reading, just think back to Wario and Waruigi.
1263 | 悪人 | あくにん | Bad Person | Villain\n Evildoer\n Bad Guy\n Wicked Person\n Evil Person | A bad person is a bad person. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1264 | 野球 | やきゅう | Baseball |  | Field Sphere! The greatest sport to grace this earth since a very similar (aka the same) sport, baseball. Think about it, you play on a field and you use a little sphere. Awesome! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1265 | 飲み物 | のみもの | Beverage | Drink | A thing you drink is a beverage. \n These are both the kun'yomi readings. You've learned them already, so you already know how to read this word!
1266 | 酒飲み | さけのみ | Boozer | Drunkard | We have alcohol and a variant form of 飲む (to drink). So you know this has to do with drinking alcohol. It means a boozer or a drunkard, someone who drinks a lot of alcohol! \n The readings are the vocab words お酒 and 飲む combined together into one. You can guess it's a kun'yomi reading because of the み on the end of 飲, which should make you think back to vocab words that use these kanji and the kun'yomi readings. If you can do that, you can read this word (and many others, probably!).
1267 | 親分 | おやぶん | Boss | Kingpin\n Chief\n Head | Who is part parent to you? Your boss! They make it so you can take care of yourself by paying you, don't they? They'll break the legs of someone who crosses you. But they won't help you get back to sleep after you have nightmares. So they're only part like a parent. \n This word consists of the kun'yomi reading for 親 and the on'yomi reading for 分. You've learned both of these so you should be able to read this already!
1268 | 息 | いき | Breath |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You smell someone's icky (いき) breath. It's gross. Your skin crawls and your eyes roll back in your head from the icky, icky smell. You might die.
1269 | 商売 | しょうばい | Business | Commerce\n Trade | Selling merchandise is business, commerce, or trade. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You've learned them both already!
1270 | 心配事 | しんぱいごと | Cares | Worries\n Troubles | Remember how 心配 means "a worry" and 事 can mean "thing"? Well, if you have a worry over some specific thing, then you probably have some cares and worries. What are your 心配事 these days? \n The reading is the reading of 心配 (which you've hopefully gotten down okay by now) and 事 using the (こと) reading. It is rendaku'd, as well, so beware of the ごと (just another 心配事, amiright?).
1271 | 虫歯 | むしば | Cavity | Decayed Tooth\n Tooth Decay | A tooth bug... Luckily, it's not some bug living in your tooth, though you can see why someone might think this is what happens. A tooth with a "bug" in it is a tooth with a cavity. \n The readings are both kun'yomi, but those are the readings you learned with these kanji. Notice that は turns to ば, though. Presumably this is because you might yell out "BAH!" when you find out you have a cavity.
1272 | 第二章 | だいにしょう | Chapter Two | Second Chapter | The ordinal number prefix two chapter has a much simpler way of describing it, which is chapter two. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1273 | 陽気 | ようき | Cheerful | Jovial\n Merry\n Lively\n Spring Season\n Warm Weather | If you have a spirit of sunshine you're a really cheerful person. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1274 | 童話 | どうわ | Children's Story | Fairy Tale | Don't think of this as a juvenile talk. Think of 話 the vocab word, which means "story." If you do that, you get a "juvenile story." What's a juvenile story? It's a children's story. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1275 | 音読み | おんよみ | Chinese Reading | On'yomi | The sound reading. What could this be...? Wait a sec, think to Japanese and kanji. What's the reading that uses sounds from another place, specifically China? That's the Chinese reading, aka the on'yomi. Sounds familiar? \n The reading for 音 is the 音読み. 読み uses the kun'yomi, though, strangely. Way to mess up the one word that should be all on'yomi, Japan. Way. To. Go.
1276 | 都市 | とし | City | Municipality | A metropolis city is a city. When you're referring to just a plain ol' city, sans name, you can use this word. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1277 | 部室 | ぶしつ | Clubroom |  | A club room is a clubroom! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1278 | 寒い | さむい | Cold |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of cold? It's cold.\n寒い is used specifically for when you feel cold. You can say it when you're outside on a chilly winter day, for example, or when you walk into a cold room. It can even be used as a response to unfunny jokes that leave you cold. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading which you learned with the kanji (Samurai (さむ)). Remember?
1279 | 会社員 | かいしゃいん | Company Employee | Office Worker | A "company" (会社) member is someone who works at a company. This is a company employee. There are many of these in Japan. Most of them are drunk. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1280 | 落ち | おち | Conclusion | Final Result\n The End\n Punch Line\n Slip\n Omission\n Outcome | When you're talking or writing a paper, the part that falls at the end is the conclusion. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already so you should be able to read it!
1281 | 大根 | だいこん | Daikon | Japanese Radish | This will be easier if you've seen or heard of daikon before. It's a really big root in the ground that's pretty delicious. It's known as daikon in the grocery stores for the most part, though occasionally you'll see it as Japanese radish instead. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. 大 uses the だい reading because if you try to put the whole thing in your mouth at once you'll probably end up choking and dying.
1282 | 深い | ふかい | Deep |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of deep? It's also deep. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. Because the reading sounds just like a dirty word, and there may be innocent children about, I'll let you come up with your own mnemonic for this one. Maybe someone pushes you into a deep hole that will surely kill you so you yell something out as you fall down it?
1283 | 最深 | さいしん | Deepest | The Deepest | The most deep is the deepest.\n最深 is a formal word used in geology to describe the deepest point of things like caves and oceans. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1284 | 歯医者 | はいしゃ | Dentist |  | You know that a 医者 is a doctor. So what is a tooth doctor? A dentist. Seriously, don't forget to floss. 歯医者 hate when you forget to floss. \n You know how to read 歯 and 医者, so you should be good to go!
1285 | 消化 | しょうか | Digestion |  | What is something that will first extinguish something and then change it? One thing I can think of is your body. It takes in food, extinguishes it in your stomach, then changes it into things your body can use (and then excrete). That's why this "extinguish-change" process is your digestion. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1286 | 二倍 | にばい | Double | Two Times\n Twice\n Twofold | Something that is two times is double (or it is just simply two times). Of course, this all works with things like 三倍, 百倍, and 四十二倍 as well. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1287 | 運転手 | うんてんしゅ | Driver |  | You know that 運転 has to do with driving, right? And you know that 手 often has to do with a person doing something in words like these. So, a person who does driving is what? A driver. \n The reading is all on'yomi, because it's jukugo. You should know the on'yomi reading of 手 by now just by seeing similar word patterns to this one.
1288 | 社員 | しゃいん | Employee | Staff\n Company Employee\n Company Staff | The company members are the employees and the staff. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1289 | 民族 | みんぞく | Ethnic Group | Ethnicity\n Race | A peoples tribe (or tribe of peoples) is a group that all stick together. They are one single ethnic group. What's your 民族? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1290 | 運動 | うんどう | Exercise | Sport | When you carry your movements (or carry something along with your movements, like weights, for example) you are doing exercise. Speaking of which, perhaps you've been studying kanji a little too much lately. Time to get up and do some squats. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1291 | 期待 | きたい | Expectation | Anticipation | For a period of time you have to wait. During this waiting period, you’re building up an expectation or anticipation for something to happen a certain way. Waiting, expecting, waiting, expecting…\n期待 specifically refers to the feeling of expectation or anticipation for a desired outcome. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1292 | 落ち葉 | おちば | Fallen Leaves | Fallen Leaf | The leaf that falls are fallen leaves. \n The reading for this one is a bit strange. You'll have to pull from your knowledge of 落ちる and use that for the first half. Then, 葉 is rendaku'd to ば. Because, when a leaf falls, Scrooge says "BAH! Humbug!" (probably because he's losing money).
1293 | 家庭 | かてい | Family | Household\n Home | The essence of your house and garden is your family, household, or home. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1294 | 家族 | かぞく | Family | Immediate Family | Your house tribe is your family. They live in the same house as you and they're part of your "tribe." This is closer than family, though (depending on how you look at family). This is your immediate family because these are the people you live with and give birth to, etc. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1295 | 父親 | ちちおや | Father | Dad | Your father parent is your father. \n The reading here is pretty weird. It's all kun'yomi. My guess is this translates literally to "father parent" (two different words, therefore uses the other readings). You should know the readings of these two separate words, though. It is 父 (ちち) and 親 (おや).
1296 | 疲労 | ひろう | Fatigue | Weariness | You're tired from labor. From this, you're showing fatigue and weariness.\n疲労 is a little formal, so you might encounter it more often in writing than in conversation. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1297 | 祭 | まつり | Festival |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n While at a festival, a guy named Matt has to go to the bathroom. Matt’s urine (まつり) has been filling up his bladder ever since he began drinking that 64oz cup of soda. Matt’s urine is ready to bust out at any moment. He really has to go to the bathroom.\nThis word can also be written 祭り, and the pronunciation stays the same.
1298 | 祭日 | さいじつ | Festival Day | National Holiday | A festival day is obviously a festival day. This word technically refers to days for Shinto festivals or rituals, but sometimes people also use it to mean a general national holiday. This is because some of the Japanese national holidays are based on those traditional Shinto festival days! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1299 | 一階 | いっかい | First Floor | Floor One\n Ground Floor\n First Story | The one floor is the first floor (or floor one). In Japan, that means the ground floor. Pretty simple. \n The reading is on'yomi because it's a jukugo kanji. Be careful of the 一 though. It gets shortened and has a little っ in there.
1300 | 第一位 | だいいちい | First Place | First Rank | You have the ordinal number prefix and 一位 (first place). By adding the prefix 第, you can make it a little more formal, but it still means first place. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1301 | 一流 | いちりゅう | First Rate | First Class\n Top Notch\n Top Grade | This is a weird one. You have one stream. This is first rate stream material we have here, though. If you think about it, if you only have one stream (instead of a ton of streams), you can put all your effort and energy into it. When you do that, you're making sure it is a first rate stream in terms of quality and anything else. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1302 | 〜階 | かい | Floor | Story\n Storey | You know that the kanji refers to a floor (as in the "fifth floor"). This word represents the version that comes after a number, shown with a 〜. Essentially, this has the same meaning as the kanji you learned, making it nice and easy.\nNote that floor-counting systems can vary across different countries. In Japan the ground floor is generally called 一階, with the floors above being 二階, 三階, and so on. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Don't type in the 〜 or you'll get it wrong!
1303 | 四十二階 | よんじゅうにかい | Forty Second Floor | Floor Forty Two\n Forty Second Story | You know that 四十二 means "forty two." So, as long as you know floor you'll know this means forty-second floor. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1304 | 庭 | にわ | Garden | Yard | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. You can add the meaning yard to your memory bank as well, if you'd like. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You look at your garden. It doesn't meet your expectations so you decide it's time to get a newer (にわ) garden. Tear it all down, folks! Getting a newer garden, here!
1305 | 集まり | あつまり | Gathering | Meeting\n Assembly\n Party\n Collection\n Get Together | This is the noun version of the kanji gather, so it means gathering. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already so you should be able to read it!
1306 | 大学院生 | だいがくいんせい | Graduate Student | Grad Student | Remember how you learned that 大学院 means "graduate school" and 大学生 means "college student?" Well smush them together and you have a  graduate student! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1307 | 港 | みなと | Harbor | Port | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This is a single kanji with no okurigana, so it's using the kun'yomi reading. You don't know this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou go down to the harbor and speak the secret password me natto (みなと) to buy some fresh natto. Imagine the salty air hitting your face as you whisper, "me natto." Now eat that yummy natto by the water! Mmmm!
1308 | 彼 | かれ | He |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
1309 | 聞こえる | きこえる | Hearable | Audible\n To Be Able To Hear\n To Be Heard\n To Be Audible\n Can Hear | You've seen 聞く by now hopefully. This is similar, but instead of meaning "to hear" it means hearable (or to be audible). Just think about that こえ hanging off there as the voice you can hear. \n The reading comes from 聞く, so if you know the reading of that word, you can apply it here.
1310 | 広島 | ひろしま | Hiroshima |  | The wide island... this isn't helpful on its own, but this wide island is Hiroshima (heard of it?). When you do the reading it will make more sense. \n The reading is the kun'yomi readings of both of these which is what you learned with the individual kanji. Just make sure you know those readings and you'll be able to read this.
1311 | 温泉 | おんせん | Hot Springs | Onsen | A warm spring (like the water kind of spring) is a hot spring. These are really nice. You should go to them in Japan. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1312 | 湯 | ゆ | Hot Water |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
1313 | 暑い | あつい | Hot Weather | Hot | This is the adjective form of hot... but we're going to call it hot weather. Why? Because there's a difference between something that's hot and the weather or atmosphere being hot. This is that kind of hot, as in..."Damn, man, it's hot out here!" \n This uses the same reading as the one you learned with the kanji, so you're good to go here!
1314 | 僕 | ぼく | I | Me | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well! \n This word uses the same reading as the one you learned with the kanji.  I certainly like that and I bet you do too.
1315 | 利息 | りそく | Interest |  | You receive profit at every breath. What kind of profit is this? It's interest. As time goes by and as you take more breaths you gain more bank interest. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1316 | 島 | しま | Island |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
1317 | 顔文字 | かおもじ | Kaomoji |  | Remember how you learned that 文字 can mean "characters?" Well make a face out of those characters and you've made a kaomoji! ʅ(◔౪◔ ) ʃ \n This word consists of the kun'yomi reading for 顔 added to the jukugo word 文字 that you already learned. You've learned these readings before, so reading this word should be nice and easy!
1318 | 京都 | きょうと | Kyoto | Kyouto | The capital metropolis back in the day was Kyoto. Now of course the capital is Tokyo, but kanji doesn't know this. That's why Kyoto is the capital metropolis! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1319 | 終電 | しゅうでん | Last Train | The Last Train | We've seen a few times where 電 refers to a train. They're big deals, after all, and use a ton of electricity. So, the end train for this word would refer to the last train. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1320 | 一代 | いちだい | Lifetime | One Lifetime\n Generation\n One Generation | This word has the kanji for one and period. You only have one period to live in so this is the only lifetime you get. Unless you're reborn, but that will probably be in the next age, not this one. So one lifetime for you! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1321 | 運 | うん | Luck |  | This takes the luck meaning from the kanji. Think of it this way: If you're "carrying" you're going to create your own luck. Now nobody will mess with you, kanji gangstah. You carry guns and have a ton of luck because of it. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji! How... shall I say... luck-filled?
1322 | 本流 | ほんりゅう | Mainstream |  | The origin stream, that's where everything comes from. That is the mainstream. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1323 | 会員 | かいいん | Member | Membership | If you meet enough members you will become a member yourself! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1324 | 商人 | しょうにん | Merchant | Trader\n Shopkeeper\n Tradesperson | A merchandise person is a merchant. You want to buy something or you just looking? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1325 | 深夜 | しんや | Middle Of The Night | Late At Night | The deep night is the middle of the night. It doesn't get any deeper than that before you start coming out of the night to start the next day. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1326 | 母親 | ははおや | Mother | Mom | The mother parent is the mother. \n The reading for this is strange. It's the kun'yomi vocab reading, probably because the literal translation is "mother parent" and therefore consists of a couple words combined together into one concept. So, make sure you know the separate word readings of 母 and 親. If you do, you should be able to read this too.
1327 | 登山 | とざん | Mountain Climbing |  | Climb a mountain. That is mountain climbing. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Note this uses the alternative と reading, not to be confused with とう (actually, very confusing, sorry!). Just imagine you cut your toe off with an ice pick while mountain climbing. You know it's a short と because your toe is now short. And さん becomes ざん thanks to our old friend rendaku.
1328 | 都合 | つごう | One's Convenience | Circumstances | This one makes no sense (sorry!). When you join together with someone at a metropolis, you do it at your convenience. You're important, after all, so you just do what you want and make the other person wait in this giant metropolis while you move along leisurely. Imagine this, and keep thinking "at your convenience" as you walk about.\nThis word is usually used in a nicer way, though. As in, "do it at your convenience!" \n The reading for 都 is an exception from what you learned with the kanji. To remember this, just think about someone who does something at their own convenience. They say, I'm going to go (つごう) where I want, when I want, at my own convenience.\nThe 合 (ごう) part is a reading you know from the kanji, though, so if you can get to "to go" with the mnemonic, you should be able to put two and two together to know that it's a long vowel ごう.
1329 | 根気 | こんき | Patience | Perseverance\n Persistence | The root of your energy. You have to dig deep into your energy, all the way to the origin and source of it, to have enough patience to deal with this dumb kid who's eating away at your not-root energy. It's all you have, and you need to use it. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1330 | 期間 | きかん | Period | Term\n Interval | A period of time interval is still a period or interval of time. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1331 | 植物 | しょくぶつ | Plant | Vegetation | Plant things are plants or vegetation. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.
1332 | 屋根 | やね | Roof |  | The root of your roof is still your roof. If it helps, imagine roots growing out of your roof. They protect you from the rain. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings. The kun'yomi for 根 is ね. For a mnemonic, we'll use the sound a horse makes, neigh (ね). Why is the horse neigh-ing? It's stuck on the roof.
1333 | 根 | ね | Root |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThis is a magic root that turns you into a horse. You take a bite and let out a loud neigh (ね)!
1334 | 根本 | こんぽん | Root | Source\n Origin\n Foundation | The root origin is the root of something. Possibly even more root than root, but we'll stick with root. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Careful, 本 is ぽん, which is a weird rendaku.
1335 | 船員 | せんいん | Sailor | Seaman\n Mariner\n Crewman | A member of a boat is called a sailor. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1336 | 学期 | がっき | School Term | Semester | The study period of time isn't the pitiful amount of time you spend studying. It's something much bigger: the school term. Ugh, how much longer is this study period of time??? \n The reading is on'yomi because it's a jukugo word but がく gets shortened to がっ, so be careful. Maybe you just wish the school term would get shorter which is why you shortened がく like that?
1337 | 二階 | にかい | Second Floor | Floor Two\n Second Story | The two floor is the second floor. In Japan, that means the floor above the ground floor. Going up! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1338 | 店員 | てんいん | Shop Staff | Store Staff\n Store Employee\n Shop Employee\n Clerk\n Shop Assistant | The shop member is someone who is a "member" (aka employed by) the shop. This is the shop staff. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1339 | 短い | みじかい | Short |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of short? It's short.\nThis word is used to describe things that are short in length, not in height. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWho has short hair and always wears shorts? It's Ms. Carr (みじか)! Everyone always recognizes Ms. Carr because she's the one with the short hair and shorts, no matter the weather. Ms. Carr, the ultimate short style icon!
1340 | 短期 | たんき | Short Period | Short-Term | The short period of time is the short term. You know not to think short term anyways, right? You're learning kanji, after all. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1341 | 短刀 | たんとう | Short Sword | Dagger\n Tanto | The short sword is the short sword. What's another word for a short sword? It's a dagger. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1342 | 誰か | だれか | Someone |  | 誰 is who, 誰か is like asking "who?" If you don't know who it is, you just know it's someone. \n The reading comes from the reading you learned with the kanji.
1343 | 息子 | むすこ | Son |  | The breath child (that lets you release your breath when it's born) is a son. Nowadays it's cool to have a girl, but back in the day you wanted a son to carry on your underwater basket weaving legacy. That's why this is a son. \n The reading of this is messed up. 子 is こ, that should be okay. 息 is むす for some reason though. Why? Because you gave birth to a son, but he was a moose (むす). You better hold that breath again, because this is not what you wanted.
1344 | 球 | たま | Sphere | Ball\n Sports Ball | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n球 has a slightly technical sound and highlights the sphere shape of the object you're talking about. It's most commonly used to refer to sports balls (as a more formal alternative to ボール). \n This word is made up of a single kanji, so it should use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou see a sphere in Tamara's (たま) hand. You're not totally sure what it is, but it's really spherical. Maybe it's some kind of sports ball. Remember Tamara, the local ball girl? It would totally make sense for Tamara to be holding either a sphere or a sports ball, since that's kind of all she does.\nYou might notice 球 has the same reading as the vocab word 玉. Their meanings are kind of similar too, so this reading should be a bit easier to remember!
1345 | 泉 | いずみ | Spring | Fountain | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You're looking at a natural spring in the ground. Water is bubbling up, but then something changes. It looks a bit clogged... something is poking out. Then, all of a sudden, Mario flies out of the springs, falls in front of you and yells: "izumeeeee (いずみ), Mario!"
1346 | 着々 | ちゃくちゃく | Steadily |  | Something you wear, and wear again, is something you steadily wear. You do it so often, it's reliable. Also, if you wear something this much it's steadily wearing away too. \n This word uses on'yomi readings of the kanji you learned, twice. You should be able to read this on your own.
1347 | 湯気 | ゆげ | Steam | Vapor | Hot water's energy isn't the hot water itself, it's what comes out of it (when it's boiling, for example). This is the steam and vapor. \n The ゆ part of the reading makes sense. The げ part for 気 is a bit of an exception, so here's a mnemonic to help with that:\nNo creature likes steam and vapor more than geckos (げ). Geckos live in hot places, so wherever you see steam, you'll be sure to see at least one gecko nearby, if you look hard enough.
1348 | 勉強 | べんきょう | Studies | Study | Your exertion is strong. You'd think this means you're working hard or something, but it means studies (like studies you have for a test or something). So for this, just imagine yourself exerting yourself really strongly on your homework. These are your studies / what you study. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1349 | 太陽 | たいよう | Sun | The Sun\n Sol | The fat sunshine thing up in the sky... what is it called? Oh, that's right. It's the sun. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1350 | 水泳 | すいえい | Swimming | Swim | When you're doing a water swim, you're really just… well, swimming.\nNote that 水泳 will usually refer to swimming as a sport or organized activity. When talking about swimming as a general action, 泳ぎ and 泳ぐ are more commonly used. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You've learned this reading for 水, but not for 泳, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThe only way you can swim is by chasing after acorns (えい). If somebody isn't dangling an acorn on a stick right in front of your face, you'd never get the motivation to swim. Good thing you're this into acorns.
1351 | 茶の湯 | ちゃのゆ | Tea Ceremony |  | The hot water of tea. That is part of the ceremony that goes into the tea ceremony. \n The readings are both the readings you learned with the kanji. Now you can spend a little more time drinking tea at a tea ceremony and a little less time trying to remember kanji readings.
1352 | 気温 | きおん | Temperature | Air Temperature | The energy of the warmth will cause the temperature to go up and down. Energy goes up? Higher temperature because of more movement and activity. Energy goes down? Well, temperature gets colder and slower. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1353 | 温度 | おんど | Temperature |  | The warm degrees is how many degrees warm it is in here. Of course, there can be very few warm degrees as well, making it very cold. What is all this? It's the temperature. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1354 | 地球 | ちきゅう | The Earth | The Globe\n Earth | The earth sphere! It's where we live and the planet we call home. It's the earth! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1355 | 終わり | おわり | The End | End\n The Finish\n Finish | By now you should know that 終わる means "to end" or "to finish." So what is this noun-version of that word? It would be the end or the finish. \n The reading comes from 終わる. So long as you know that word, you can learn this word's reading as well!
1356 | 第一 | だいいち | The First | First\n Number One\n Best | The ordinal number prefix one refers to the first thing. This is the number one place you can get. In fact, it's simply the best. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1357 | 最悪 | さいあく | The Worst | Worst | The most bad is the worst. At least it can’t get any worse… \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1358 | 彼ら | かれら | They |  | This is he but plural. The "ra" makes it plural, making it "they" or "them." While this gennnnnnerally refers to a group of males, it can include ladies too. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
1359 | 三番目 | さんばんめ | Third Thing | The Third | Remember 一番目? This is just like that, but with three, making it the third thing or simply the third. \n Use your knowledge of the reading for 一番目 to remember the reading for this word as well.
1360 | 時期 | じき | Time | Season\n Period | The time period of time is a period of time of time. If anything, just notice how many times the word "time" is used and you'll remember this word means time. The meaning is a specific type of time, though. This is talking about a season or period of time, not the concept of time itself. That would be 時間 or something. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1361 | 〜倍 | ばい | Times | Fold | Throw this onto a number and you have yourself the number of times something has increased. For example, ３倍 means something increased "three fold." \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Omit the 〜 when writing out the answer, though. That just represents that there should be something before the kanji in this word when being used.
1362 | 始まる | はじまる | To Begin | Something Begins\n To Start\n Something Starts | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. Something starts. No direct object here. That's why this verb means to start. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\nLucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as 始める.
1363 | 伝わる | つたわる | To Be Transmitted | To Be Told\n To Be Handed Down | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. Something is transmitted. No direct object here. That's why this verb means to be transmitted. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\nLucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as 伝える.
1364 | 登る | のぼる | To Climb | To Ascend | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means climb so the verb vocab version would be to climb (or to ascend), if that's the kind of thing you're into. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. This has the same reading as 上る which you learned all that time ago in Level 1. If you can remember that, you can remember this one!
1365 | 取れる | とれる | To Come Off | To Be Removed\n To Fall Off | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. Something comes off. Something is removed. No direct object here. That's why this verb means to come off or to be removed. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\nLucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as 取る.
1366 | 集まる | あつまる | To Come Together | To Gather\n To Be Gathered | I bet you remember 集める which means "to collect." This is similar to that, except you're not doing the action of collecting, it's just happening. Instead of "to collect" it's to come together. You can remember this because a herd of Marus (the cat) will come together into one place if they sense a box there. \n The reading is the same as 集める so if you know that word you'll know how to read this word as well.
1367 | 要求する | ようきゅうする | To Demand Something |  | You hopefully remember that 要求 means "demand" . When you make that a verb, it becomes to demand something. \n The reading is just the vocab word 要求. It's also the regular on'yomi jukugo reading.
1368 | 落とす | おとす | To Drop Something | To Let Something Fall\n To Lose Something | You've seen how 落ちる means "to fall down." Now you're doing the action of "falling something down," aka you're dropping it. You can remember this because you kind of toss (とす) something and it drops to the ground, making this word mean to drop something. \n The reading comes from 落ちる. So long as you know that word you can apply that reading over here, too.
1369 | 消す | けす | To Extinguish Something | To Erase Something\n To Turn Something Off | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means extinguish so the verb vocab version is to extinguish something. You can also use this word to say to erase something, like data, and to turn something off, like the lights or the power. Technically you're extinguishing the data, as well as the lights or power, right? \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to extinguish the fire! The kettle (け) got too hot, and it caught on fire.
1370 | 転ぶ | ころぶ | To Fall Over | To Fall Down | Do you remember the word 転がる? This is kind of similar, instead of rolling, this is more for when something falls and hits the ground. It means to fall over or to fall down. Just imagine someone falling off a chair face first into the dirt and making a ぶ sound. \n The reading comes from 転がる. Hopefully you know that one well enough to associate it with this one, meaning you can read them both.
1371 | 終える | おえる | To Finish Something | To End Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means finish, so the verb version is to finish something or to end something.\nThis is a transitive verb, meaning you finish something, like a long day at work!\nYou need to differentiate this from 終わる, which is when something just ends on its own. 終える is about when you make something end. Remember it like this: Canadians always end their sentences with "eh" え, right? Well that's how you know they're ending their sentence. Just listen for the "eh," eh? \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou finally finished your school project. "Oh, A!" (おえ) you say to yourself, as though you can grade your own project.
1372 | 流す | ながす | To Flush Something | To Pour Something\n To Set Something Afloat | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means stream. If you're streaming water, it might be to flush something. Alternatively, to pour something makes a stream of liquid, and to set something afloat is to make something flow in the stream. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhat do you do with someone who is a nagger (one who nags)? You have to flush them down the toilet. Imagine someone nagging you to do your chores so you flush them down the toilet, somehow.
1373 | 苦しめる | くるしめる | To Hurt Someone | To Torment\n To Harass | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means suffer, and the verb is all about when you make someone else suffer. That's why it's to hurt someone, to torment, or to harass.\nYou need to differentiate this from 苦しむ, which is about when YOU suffer. You can remember that 苦しめる is about making someone else suffer with this mnemonic: Who made you suffer? She made (しめ) me suffer! She's so mean! \n By now, you've learned 苦しい and 苦しむ. The kanji in these words all use the same reading! Yay!
1374 | 東京都 | とうきょうと | Tokyo Metropolis | Tokyo Metro\n Tokyo Metropolitan Area\n Tokyo Metro Area | The Tokyo Metropolis is, of course, the Tokyo Metropolis. Technically this is one of Japan's prefectures, but it's called a "Metropolis" instead. It's the capital and the largest city in all of Japan! \n The reading is just 東京 and 都 (と). Really it's all just the reading you learned with the kanji, too, so you can think of it that way as well.
1375 | 動く | うごく | To Move | To Function | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means move so the verb vocab version is to move. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Someone is telling you to move. They are saying "you go (うご) over there. Move! Move!" If it helps, have them pronounce "You go" more like "Ugo."
1376 | 起こる | おこる | To Occur | To Happen\n To Take Place | You know that 起きる means "to wake up", but did you learn its secondary meaning, "to occur"? Well, this word means only to occur. Just imagine an incident occurring involving a uranium core (こる) to remember that this means to occur. After all, uranium core incidents don't wake up, do they? \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji and the same as 起きる too, meaning you should be able to put together the reading on your own.
1377 | 開く | あく | To Open | To Be Open | You should know 開ける by now. This word is similar to that, except it has to do with when things are just open. It's the same thing, though. The meaning is also to open. \n Do you remember the reading for 開ける, which you learned in level 10? That's right, it's あける! So if you know the reading of that word (I hope you do!) then you can apply that knowledge here.\nJust a quick side note — 開く can also be read as ひらく, but we're going to focus on the あく reading here. Since ひらく has slightly different meanings, we won't accept it as a reading for this word, so be sure to enter あく!
1378 | 歯 | は | Tooth | Teeth | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading that you learned with the kanji is the same as this one. HA! Take that, kanji.
1379 | 植える | うえる | To Plant Something | To Grow Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means plant, so the verb version is to plant something or to grow something. \n You haven't learned this reading for 植 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou decided to plant an uni (う) tree in your backyard. That's right, you can plant sea urchins and they'll grow like fruit off a really spiky tree. Just picture it. And then you'll get to eat all the uni you want!
1380 | 映す | うつす | To Project | To Reflect | You know that 映る is "to be reflected." Now you're doing the reflecting, which is really projecting (light). That's why this word is to project. \n The reading is the same as 映る. So long as you know the reading of 映る you should be able to read this one too.
1381 | 鳴る | なる | To Ring |  | This is a lot like 鳴く, which means "to chirp" (or some other animal noise). This has to do with noises too, but not so much animal and more like bells (including telephones). This word means to ring. If it helps, think of the る as a hint, kind of like the first sound of the word "ring" (る). So, る = "ring" and it's a verb, so to ring. \n The reading can come from 鳴く. So long as you know the reading for that word you can know the reading for this word as well.
1382 | 歌う | うたう | To Sing |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. One of the kanji's meanings is sing so the verb vocab version of this is to sing. \n Awesomely, this uses the same reading as the reading for the vocab words 歌. Just throw the う onto the end and you have yourself the reading. So, sing your heart out and learn this word easily. "IIIIiiIIIiiiII WILLL ALLllwaYYYs Loovvve YoOooOOooooOOOO ♬!"
1383 | 合う | あう | To Suit | To Come Together\n To Meet\n To Match | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means suit so the verb version is to suit.\nThis word also means to come together as well. Presumably when something suits something else, it comes together with it flawlessly. That's why this word also has this other meaning (and it will be important for future vocab as well). \n You want to find a pet to suit your personal style, so you get matched with an aardvark (あ). An aardvark will match the ant mounds you use for chairs and couches, it's the perfect match.
1384 | 待つ | まつ | To Wait |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means wait so the verb version is to wait. \n You need to wait for your mama (ま) all the time. You want to go out? You have to wait for mama to drive you. Want to eat dinner? You have to wait for mama to make you food. Hmm. Maybe all this waiting is really a you problem.
1385 | 着る | きる | To Wear | To Put On | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means wear so this word means to wear or to put on. You'll need to differentiate it from 着く which means (to arrive), though. Just think of how the る is the rude guy trying to get you to wear things you don't like wearing. \n What do you want to wear today? How about a dress made entirely of keys (き)? Feel the metal on your skin and the weight on your shoulders. It's not a comfortable thing to put on. Maybe just stick with wearing a single key around your neck next time.
1386 | 心配する | しんぱいする | To Worry | To Be Concerned\n To Be Anxious | You know that 心配 is "a worry." What about the verb version of that? It would be to worry. \n The reading comes straight from 心配 so try to make sure you know that word so you can read this word! It's also all jukugo on'yomi reading, too, so you should be able to figure it out regardless.
1387 | 流行 | りゅうこう | Trend | Fad\n Craze\n Prevalence | Where the stream is going is where everyone's going. That's what tends to be the trend of things. Imagine a trend going on in your society right now. Imagine it going down a stream with everyone following it. This word is also used for less desirable trends, like the prevalence of infectious diseases. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1388 | 旅 | たび | Trip | Travel | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You are going on your trip but you need to bring your little tabby (たび) cat with you to keep you company. This cat keeps you calm and lets you leave your house, but the airlines won't let you take it on this trip. What to do?
1389 | 旅行 | りょこう | Trip | Travel | When you go on a trip you're taking a trip. This is travel. You should try to do this occasionally!

1390 | 都会 | とかい | Urban Area | City | When metropolises meet they become an urban area. This word is often used to mean city as opposed to the country or rural areas. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1391 | 温かい | あたたかい | Warm |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of warm? It's warm. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nTouch something that's warm... too warm! You pull your hand back and go "AH ta-ta! (あたた). People make this noise when they touch something that's hot, I hear. It's almost like saying "hot hot hot" while dropping the "h" sound.\nPeople often pronounce this as あったかい, especially in casual, spoken Japanese. The "correct" reading is still あたたかい though, so keep that in mind when you're trying to type the kanji or taking an important test!
1392 | 水深 | すいしん | Water Depth | Depth Of Water | The water deepness is the water depth. You should check this before diving into the water so you don't hit your face. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1393 | 話し方 | はなしかた | Way Of Speaking | Speaking Style\n Way Of Talking\n Talking Style | The way of speaking is your way of speaking (or it could be your speaking style). This is how someone talks. Some people have an interesting speaking style, after all. \n This uses the kun'yomi readings from the vocab words 話す and 方. So as long as you're okay with those, you can apply that knowledge over here.
1394 | 言葉 | ことば | Word | Language\n Manner Of Speech | A leaf of the things you say is like a leaf from a tree of speaking. That leaf is a part of the whole language, it is a single word, though it can add up to be a language or manner of speech. \n The reading for 言 is one you haven't learned, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nNow imagine that there are words all over your coat (こと).

1395 | 文章 | ぶんしょう | Writing | Sentence\n Composition | A writing chapter is just another name for a piece of writing, a.k.a. a composition. Even if it's only a single sentence! 文章 covers just about every type of writing there is. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1396 | 感心 | かんしん | Admiration |  | Your feelings are in your heart. When your feelings are in your heart they are pure feelings. You can be happy for people and feel admiration for their successes.

But while 始めに is for the beginning of some larger process, 初めに refers more to doing something first or to the initial point of a certain time frame. You might say 初めにアクビをしたのは私です (I was the one who yawned first), for example, or 今年の初めに (at the start of this year). \n This word uses the kun'yomi, which you didn't learn with the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you out.

1405 | 銀行 | ぎんこう | Bank |  | Time to go get your silver from the bank. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

1411 | 器 | うつわ | Container | Bowl\n Capacity | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n器 refers to a container or a bowl and is often used in culinary contexts. It can also be used metaphorically to describe someone's capacity for certain things. For instance, when someone has a small 器, it means they have a limited capacity to handle pressure, stress, or difficulties. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou have this container. It's upside down with a stick holding it up and a string on the stick. You're going to catch some U2s (like, the band). You put some food under it and wait. Then, out of the bushes comes Bono.

1412 | 大会 | たいかい | Convention | Tournament\n Event | When you have a big meet there's a lot of people together. Why would you have a bunch of people gather together? Probably for a convention or some kind of tournament or event. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nDid you know that Japan has entire conventions on tie kayaking (たいかい)? They regularly hold tournaments where they go kayaking using nothing but ties! Sounds pretty exhausting...
1413 | 暗い | くらい | Dark |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of dark? It's dark. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: \nYou're thrown into something dark and small. A lid is closed on top of you, and you are confused.

1417 | 酒好き | さけずき | Drinker | Alcoholic | When you like alcohol a lot, you're probably a heavy drinker. \n The reading is all kun'yomi vocab reading here as you can probably guess from the hiragana sticking out on the end. You should know the readings of these as separate words already (酒 and 好き) which means all you need to pay attention to is the rendaku of すき to ずき.
1418 | 飲み会 | のみかい | Drinking Party |  | You know that 飲む is drink, so this has to do with drinking. Also, 会 means meet, so when you meet to drink you're getting together with others to drink. It's a drinking party! \n The readings come from the 飲む vocabulary word and the regular kanji reading for 会. Hopefully you know both of those by now so you can apply them to the reading of this word, too!
1419 | 空き缶 | あきかん | Empty Can |  | A sky can is a can that has nothing but sky in it. It's an empty can. \n The reading for 空き isn't one you've seen before. Remember how 開く means "to open"?

1420 | 熱心 | ねっしん | Enthusiasm | Passion\n Zeal | When your heart is feverish and hot about something, it is obviously something you have a lot of enthusiasm about.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1422 | 皆さん | みなさん | Everyone | Everybody\n All | Everyone + さん (normal name ender). This is the normal way to say everyone \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1426 | 感じ | かんじ | Feeling | Sense\n Impression | This is a noun version of the kanji feeling. What is that? It's a feeling as well. \n The reading for both on'yomi and kun'yomi of this kanji are the same, actually. So long as you learned the reading that was with the kanji, you can't go wrong. Feel good?
1427 | 感情 | かんじょう | Feeling | Emotion | Feeling + feeling = feeling! It can also mean emotion. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1428 | 熱 | ねつ | Fever | Heat | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, so don't get all feverish over this one.
1429 | 指先 | ゆびさき | Fingertip | Tip Of The Toe | You know that previous part of your finger? The part I just chopped off? Well that was your fingertip! I only had time to get the tip. It used to be on your finger and now it's right here, in my hand. Sorry, I guess. Oh, but don't worry, I'll even things out and get the tip of your toe real quick too. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings from both kanji, probably because it includes body parts. You know them both already, so now you know this too!
1430 | 〜様 | さま | Formal Name Ender | Formal Name Title\n Sama | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nYou can add this onto the end of someone's name. It's probably too polite, to be honest, unless you're talking to one of your customers or something. It's good to know, but you're probably not going to use it much, despite seeing and hearing it fairly often. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji.
1431 | 初めて | はじめて | For The First Time | First Time | You know that 初 means "first" This word means for the first time. Think of めて as "meet." Then think "when we met for the first time ____ happened." \n This word uses the kun'yomi, which you didn't learn with the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you out. What are you beginning? You are beginning Haj (はじ). (Haj is the fifth pillar of Islam, and is a pilgrimage to Mecca during the month of Dhu al-Hijja).
1432 | 仲良く | なかよく | Friendly | Good Terms | When the relationship is good, that means you're friendly with that person. You're also on good terms. \n The readings are kun'yomi, but those are the readings you learned already, so hopefully we can stay on good terms, right?
1433 | 駅前 | えきまえ | Front Of Station | In Front Of Station\n Front Of The Station\n In Front Of The Station\n Station Front | The station front is the front of station. This word is great for telling people where you want to meet, by the way. \n This is like two separate words put together into one, so you can imagine it's the kun'yomi readings. You learned the right reading for 駅 in the kanji, and you should know the vocab word 前 by now. Combine the two together and you have yourself front of station.
1434 | 会 | かい | Gathering | Meeting\n Group\n Party | This is the noun version of the kanji meet, and it means a gathering or a meeting, as you’d expect! It isn’t really used for the kind of meeting you have at an office, though. It’s more in the sense of a people coming together for a specific purpose, like volunteer group, or a birthday party. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
1435 | 目標 | もくひょう | Goal | Target\n Objective | The signpost you have your eye on is your goal, target and objective. Just imagine looking at this signpost in the distance. You know you have to get to it from where you are. That is the goal of your journey. \n You've had the on'yomi reading of 目 with 目次 way back in level 6. For this vocab, you're trying to get to your goal, that signpost in the distance. As you're trekking towards it there are people standing to the side mocking you, telling you you'll never make it to your goal. Imagine this happening.
1436 | 神様 | かみさま | God | Gods | God (formal name ender) is God! Or the gods, if you're talking to more than one. You have to be polite to them, so you add that ender on there. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned them both already so you should be able to read this too!
1437 | 女神 | めがみ | Goddess | Female Deity | A woman who is also a god is a goddess. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You haven't learned this reading for 女 yet so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThis goddess has the most beautiful 目 (め) you've ever seen. You can't stop staring into them. This must be how people know they've met a god.
1438 | 仲良し | なかよし | Good Friend | Intimate Friend\n Close Friend | You have a good relationship with someone. This is someone who is your good friend or intimate friend. \n The readings are kun'yomi as you probably guessed from the hiragana sticking out, but that doesn't matter because you learned the kun'yomi readings already.
1439 | 緑色 | みどりいろ | Green | Color Green\n Green Color | The green color is the color green. \n The reading is the readings you learned with the kanji, combined!
1440 | 緑 | みどり | Green |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
1441 | 宿題 | しゅくだい | Homework |  | The lodge you're staying in has a topic around it. Think of it as a theme. This theme is doing your homework. So yeah, you just went to a nice lodge for vacation only to have to do homework everywhere. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1442 | 熱い | あつい | Hot Thing | Hot | This is for when a thing is hot, making this word hot thing. When the weather is hot that's 暑い. This is when you touch something and you burn yourself. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: This has the same reading as 暑い, so if you've learned that you'll know how to read this word as well. If you haven't run into that word, you've probably run into the kanji 暑 at least. That uses the reading あつ. Two similar concepts, but there are two kanji to differentiate, which gets confusing.
1443 | 人情 | にんじょう | Human Feelings | Humanity\n Empathy\n Kindness\n Sympathy | The person (people) feelings are human feelings that every person has. That is what humanity is all about, and often refers to feelings of kindness and empathy for others. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1444 | 億 | おく | Hundred Million |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, presumably because it's normally attached onto other numbers to signify how many hundred millions of ____ there are.
1445 | 俺 | おれ | I | Me | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nKeep in mind that 俺 has a more informal and masculine sound than neutral options like 私 and 僕. While it carries a rougher vibe, it's not solely reserved for tough personalities and is very common in casual chats among buddies. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
1446 | 思想 | しそう | Ideology | Thought\n Idea | When you think and contemplate deeply, you're producing something larger, like an ideology. This means having a group of, or a single larger, thought(s) or idea(s).\n思想 refers to the big ideas or beliefs an individual holds about the world and life. It’s often used to talk about one’s thoughts about philosophy, politics, religion, or other such beliefs. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You haven't learned the on'yomi for 思 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nAll your thoughts and ideas are about sheep (し) right now. You just can't stop thinking about sheep. Are you thinking about sheep right now? What kind of sheep are they?
1447 | 感想 | かんそう | Impressions | One's Impressions\n Thoughts | The feelings you contemplate about a subject are your impressions and thoughts on it.\n感想 is all about what you think or feel after experiencing something, like after reading a book, watching a movie, or going to an event. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1448 | 旅館 | りょかん | Japanese Inn | Japanese Style Hotel\n Ryokan | When you’re taking a trip to a public building, you might be staying at a Japanese inn. Those were very much public buildings for all kinds of travellers back in the day, when you think about it.\nAlternatively, you could call this a Japanese style hotel, or just by its Japanese name, ryokan. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1449 | 神風 | かみかぜ | Kamikaze | Divine Winds | Wind of the gods. These are divine winds. More popularly, this is a word known as kamikaze, which became known because of the kamikaze pilots during WWII. This was used before WWII, though, when the entire Mongol fleet was destroyed by a storm, preventing an invasion of Japan. How lucky. \n The readings are kun'yomi readings for both, probably because this is two words put together into one. You know the reading of 風 from previous levels, hopefully. Now all you need to do is apply your knowledge of the word 神 to be able to read the rest.
1450 | 王様 | おうさま | King |  | The king (formal name ender) is the king, and you're talking to him politely. He's the king after all! If you don't he might behead you! \n This word consists of the on'yomi reading for 王 and the kun'yomi reading for 様. You've learned them both so you should be able to read this word too!
1451 | 左利き | ひだりきき | Left Handed |  | If you profit from the left, you're probably doing everything on the left. That's your good side. You're probably left handed. \n The readings are the kun'yomi vocab readings, so combine the readings of the words 左 and 利く together to get the reading of this one. It makes sense since this word is like two words put together.
1452 | 小指 | こゆび | Little Finger | Pinky Finger\n Pinky\n Little Toe\n Pinky Toe | The small finger is your little finger or pinky finger. Makes sense, but it's also used for the pinky on your feet. You know, your pinky toe. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings from both kanji, probably because it includes body parts. You know them both already, so now you know this too!
1453 | 宿 | やど | Lodging | Inn\n Hotel\n Lodge | A lodge is a form of lodging. It is also considered to be an inn or hotel. \n Yah do (やど) what you must to get lodgings for the night. Whether that's an inn or hotel or whatever. Yah do what you gotta do.
1454 | 暗記 | あんき | Memorization | Memorize | In the dark if you try to write down something it won't work very well. You can't see. So, how can you "write something down" in the dark? You write it down in your mind. This is memorization! Recognize this word? The SRS application "Anki" comes from this word, I'm guessing! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1455 | 水銀 | すいぎん | Mercury | Quicksilver | This is a fun one. Water silver is mercury, which makes a lot of sense. Mercury is liquidy like water, but it is all silver like silver. So silver water isn't some new mineral water you can get for $4 at the store, it's mercury! Or quicksilver, if you prefer. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1456 | 中指 | なかゆび | Middle Finger | Second Finger\n Middle Toe | The middle finger is the middle finger, of course! And because we don't see the difference, it's your middle toe too. Stick that up the next time someone makes you mad. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings from both kanji, probably because it includes body parts. You know them both already, so now you know this too!
1457 | 鏡 | かがみ | Mirror |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
1458 | 映画館 | えいがかん | Movie Theater | Cinema\n Movie Theatre | You've already learned 映画 means "movie." A public building for movies is a movie theater. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1459 | 殺人 | さつじん | Murder |  | When a person is killed, you have yourself a murder. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1460 | 楽器 | がっき | Musical Instrument |  | Remember how 楽 was used in 音楽 and meant "music"? Well this is that 楽 again. A music container is something that can produce music. It is a musical instrument. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.\nYou have already learned the reading for 器 but 楽 uses the secondary reading so you may not have learned it.  However, you learned this reading in the word 音楽. Just bear in mind that the がく shortens to がっ.
1461 | 当然 | とうぜん | Natural | Obvious | Something that's naturally right is something that's very obvious and natural. You know that, right? 当然! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1462 | 自然 | しぜん | Nature | Natural | Self nature is nature itself. That is nature, like all those green things and 青葉 outside. Many apologies if someone hundreds of years from now is reading this. It used to be pretty green outside before the robots.\nIf you call this "natural" then you are using the な adjective 自然な, but I thought it pertinent to add that in here too. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Wait! Except 自 is し and not じ! That is because when you add the little dakuten you are adding to the し. When it has no dakuten, it is in the form that nature intended.
1463 | 一億 | いちおく | One Hundred Million |  | One hundred million is one hundred million. That's a lot of zeros. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1464 | 一億円 | いちおくえん | One Hundred Million Yen |  | One hundred million yen! So rich! You have one hundred million yen! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

You have a ton of  passion. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1466 | 体育 | たいいく | PE Class | PE\n Physical Education\n Gym Class | Remember how 教育 means "education?" Well, the 育 here is referring to the education word, but this time it's a body education. What do you call the body education at school? Physical education or PE. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1467 | 情け | なさけ | Pity | Sympathy\n Mercy\n Compassion | You have your feelings... these are the feelings humans have. When you ask someone to have feelings (Have feelings, KAY?? (け at the end)), you are asking them to pity or have mercy on you. Please! Have those human feelings that people have, like sympathy or pity. Don't kill me, man! \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Who are you begging to have pity on you? It's NASA. They have you hanging outside of the space station and they're going to push you towards earth where you'll burn up in the atmosphere. You don't want that, so you beg mission control for some pity. What will they do? You decide.
1468 | 詩 | し | Poem |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the kanji as well! You are so happy that you could write a poem all about this...\nThe vocab reading\nIs the same as the kanji\nCrabigator love\nHow was that?
1469 | 詩人 | しじん | Poet |  | A poem person is a poet. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1470 | 詩歌 | しいか | Poetry |  | A poem song is poetry. It's not quite a song but I think you can make the connection.\n詩歌 used to be for two kinds of poetry called kanshi and waka, but nowadays it's also used for other traditional Japanese poetry forms like tanka, haiku, senryu, and more. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You know these readings, but there's usually an extra い in the middle. Don't worry, しか is totally fine too, but しいか is more common. You got this!
1471 | 練習 | れんしゅう | Practice | Training\n Drill | You practice something to learn it. That's still called practice! The important part about this is that you're learning while you practice too. It's right in the word. So, when you practice kanji and Japanese vocab, make sure you're learning as well as practicing. If you're not learning, you're not really practicing, are you? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1472 | 選手 | せんしゅ | Pro Athlete | Sports Player\n Professional Athlete | Remember how 手 can mean "doer" in some words? Well this is one of them. In sports, you must choose the best doer for your team. In the world of sports, these "chosen doers" are the  pro athletes and  sports player s. \n The reading for 選 is what you'd expect. 手 is the on'yomi reading as it is every once in a while, especially when it has to do with representing a person, so you'll have to remember that. I think you've seen 手 using this reading enough to be able to remember it, though.
1473 | 問題 | もんだい | Problem | Question | The problem topic is the problem or question you have to answer. If you think about it, topics as problems tends to be a school-related thing. So, when you have to answer a problem in school, that's 問題. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1474 | 実感 | じっかん | Realization | Real Feeling\n Actual Feeling | Your truth feeling is when you feel something is true. You have the realization this is a real feeling! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. The reading for 実 gets changed to じっ so be careful!
1475 | 大好き | だいすき | Really Like | Love\n Like A Lot\n Lovable | You've hopefully seen 好き by now, which is "to like." So, what happens when you have a 大 (big) like? You really like, like a lot, or love something.\nThis is the same as 好き in that a more literal translation would be lovable, but it's generally translated as a verb in English. \n The reading comes from 好き which you've hopefully seen. Then, 大 is the reading you learned with the kanji.
1476 | 回想 | かいそう | Reminiscence | Recollection | The past events revolve around your mind as you imagine them. That's a reminiscence or recollection of those times.\n回想 refers to the reminiscence or recollection of past experiences or events. It's often used to describe flashback scenes in movies or dramas, as well as moments in literature where characters think back on their past. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1477 | 右利き | みぎきき | Right Handed |  | The right side of your body is the side you profit most from. So, you use it a lot more. That's because you're right handed. \n Both kanji use the kun'yomi vocab readings. So, think to the words 右 and 利く to learn how to read this one. It probably reads like this because it's two separate words come together (right + handed) rather than one word.
1478 | 輪 | わ | Ring | Wheel\n Loop\n Circle | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You put on the ring you found, hoping it will be the one ring to rule them all (invisibility!). Instead, it turns out it's a special Walken(わ) ring, made out of Christopher Walken's bones. It talks up to you, telling you how he kept this ring in his (*ahem*) butt during the war so he could get it to you. First of all, why is this ring talking? Second, why is it talking like Walken. Third, eww, gross, it was in his anus.
1479 | 学問 | がくもん | Schooling | Study\n Learning\n Scholarship | How can you solve your study problem? With a little extra schooling, study, and learning. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1480 | 課長 | かちょう | Section Manager | Section Chief | Remember how 社長 is the company president? This uses the same 長 meaning (where it means something like "boss"). Since 課 means section, this is the section manager. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1481 | 彼女 | かのじょ | She | Girlfriend | A he woman is she. Also could mean girlfriend, depending on how it's used. \n The reading for this is a bit weird, at least for the 彼 portion. Just think about how she (your girlfriend) is a canoe (かの), and you love that canoe girlfriend more than anything. She is your best friend and your lover, and everyone thinks you're weird. Imagine everyone thinking you're weird as you give kisses to your canoe girlfriend.
1482 | 新宿 | しんじゅく | Shinjuku |  | The new lodge area is Shinjuku, a popular district in Tokyo. Perhaps there are many places to stay in Shinjuku. Either way, you should visit, it's fun! It will help if you've heard of Shinjuku before, too. Do some research about Shinjuku if you've never heard of it. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just be careful of the しゅく changing to じゅく. Once again, will help if you've heard of Shinjuku.
1483 | 銀 | ぎん | Silver |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the kanji.
1484 | 銀色 | ぎんいろ | Silver | Silver Color\n Color Silver | The silver color is just silver (the color). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1485 | 特選 | とくせん | Special Selection | Special Choice\n Special Prize | If something is special you choose it. That makes it a special selection of yours and it gets a special prize that only you could give! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1486 | 駅 | えき | Station | Train Station | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Usually this refers to a train station in particular, but can be any kind of station. \n The kanji here uses えき as both its on'yomi and kun'yomi, so no worries here. You can go to this station or that station, and both stations will use the same reading as the kanji it comes from.
1487 | 駅長 | えきちょう | Station Master | Stationmaster\n Train Station Master\n Train Stationmaster | This word uses 長 in the same way as 社長, where it means something like "boss" or "manager." So, this 長 is the boss of the station, right? What do you call someone like that? You call them the stationmaster (that is, unless you want to be thrown to the trains). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1488 | 自殺 | じさつ | Suicide |  | A self kill is when you kill yourself. That's suicide. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1489 | 力士 | りきし | Sumo Wrestler |  | A power samurai isn't a samurai at all. A Samurai's all about precision, after all. So, imagine someone that's a huge mass of muscle (and fat). This Japanese warrior is all about power... ramming into people as hard as they can to knock them over. This person is a sumo wrestler. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1490 | 同感 | どうかん | Sympathy | Same Sentiment\n Concurrence\n Agree\n Empathy | When you have the same feeling as someone else, you have sympathy for them, because you know how they feel. How kind of you! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1491 | 食器 | しょっき | Tableware | Eating Utensils\n Serving Utensils | Your eating containers refer to tableware, including eating utensils, such as knives, forks, spoons, and chopsticks, as well as serving utensils, like plates, bowls, and saucers. Basically, it's stuff you use to eat your food. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just be sure to note the shortened しょく.
1492 | 田代島 | たしろじま | Tashirojima |  | A rice paddy is used as a substitute for an island. Which island is it? That's right, Tashirojima. Imagine a rice paddy in the middle of the sea, standing in for Tashiro Island \n This is a place name and it uses the kun'yomi. You haven't learned this particular kun'yomi for 代 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\nWhen you go to Tashirojima, make sure you visit the old woman. You know what woman I'm talking about, the one who starred on Murder she wrote (しろ). She writes a lot about cats now, I guess.
1493 | 感謝 | かんしゃ | Thanks | Gratitude | You have feelings of apologizing. Strangely, this word means thanks and gratitude, though. Perhaps someone did something so nice for you that you want to apologize for how many nice things they're doing for you. You are this grateful to them! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1494 | 五感 | ごかん | The Five Senses | Five Senses | The five feelings that you have are what? Sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell (don't count the sixth one where you see dead people). These are the five senses that you probably have. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1495 | 親指 | おやゆび | Thumb | Big Toe | Your parent finger is your thumb! It's bigger than your other fingers, so that means it's in charge too! This goes for the fingers on your feet too, I mean, your toes. So the parent toe is your big toe. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings from both kanji, probably because it includes body parts. You know them both already, so now you know this too!
1496 | 車輪 | しゃりん | Tire | Car Wheel\n Wheel | A car rings are what part of your car? Those are your tires. So, a car ring is a tire. This can also mean car wheel, or the wheel of some other vehicle. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1497 | 疲れ | つかれ | Tiredness | Fatigue | 疲れる is "to get tired." This is the noun version, which makes it tiredness or fatigue.\n疲れ is a more casual version of 疲労, so people commonly choose 疲れ over 疲労 in everyday conversation. \n The reading comes from 疲れる.
1498 | 謝る | あやまる | To Apologize |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means apologize so the verb vocab version is to apologize. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: When you say you're sorry to apologize, you'd probably start with: "I am (あやま) sorry!"
1499 | 着く | つく | To Arrive |  | This word can be tough because it uses the same kanji as 着る (to wear). This word, however, means to arrive. You should have learned that meaning with the kanji 着 as well, so perhaps that helps. To differentiate between this and 着る, try to focus on the く. You really want to be cool (く), so you always make sure "to arrive" late to parties. \n This uses a different kun'yomi reading than the one you just learned (sorry). To help you, think about this:\nYou wanted to arrive on time but you showed up late. How late were you? Two (つ) hours and two minutes late, to be exact.
1500 | 空く | あく | To Become Empty | To Become Vacant\n To Become Available | You have the kanji for empty, so this verb means to become empty.\nIt can also have a slightly different meaning when it's read differently, but you'll learn this through other words later on, so don't worry about it for now. \n Whenever something is about to become empty, you can't help saying "Ah…" (あ) to express your disappointment. Your glass of water is becoming empty? Ah… Your bag of chips is becoming empty? Ah… Exclaiming a little "Ah…" is the only thing that helps you cope with the sadness of your favorite things becoming empty.
1501 | 感動する | かんどうする | To Be Emotionally Moved | To Be Moved Emotionally\n To Be Moving | You know this is a verb from the する. Your feelings have been moved. So, when your feelings have been moved, you are emotionally moved. This word is to be emotionally moved or simply to be moving. Just be sure to know this has to do with emotions. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1502 | 放れる | はなれる | To Be Released |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means release and the verb vocab version means to be released. You can differentiate this one from 放す (to release) by thinking that it's pretty rare (れる) for you to be released by your arch nemesis. He just let you go, strangely. How rare. \n The reading comes from 放す. As long as you know that word you can apply that reading over here as well.
1503 | 育てる | そだてる | To Bring Up | To Raise\n To Cultivate | This is similar to 育つ, except now you're doing the raising of someone. This word means to bring up or to raise. You can remember this because of the てる. Your version of bringing a child up involves tearing (てる) all their clothes to make them look poor so they can get the cheaper lunch at school. You're rich because of all the tax breaks you get from all the children you're raising, but you could always use more money to fuel your StarCraft addiction (we've all been there). \n The reading comes from 育つ. So long as you know that one, you know how to read this one as well.
1504 | 追い付く | おいつく | To Catch Up With | To Overtake\n To Keep Up With | To follow then attach yourself to the whoever you're following is to catch up with someone. \n The readings are the ones you learned with the kanji, but you can also just notice that this word includes 追う and 付く combined.
1505 | 選ぶ | えらぶ | To Choose |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means "choose", so the verb version is to choose. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have the opportunity to choose. You choose, and a bright sign lights up reading "error" (えら).
1506 | 感じる | かんじる | To Feel |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means feeling so the verb vocab version is to feel. \n Guess what? Even though this would use the vocab kun'yomi reading, usually, the readings for both on'yomi and kun'yomi on this kanji are the same, meaning you can read this word no matter what. Feeling better now?
1507 | 戦う | たたかう | To Fight | To Battle\n To Combat | This is the verb version of the vocab word 戦い, which I'm hoping you learned earlier. The verb version of course means to fight or to battle. \n The reading comes from 戦い a word you've hopefully seen by now. Associate these words together in your mind and you'll be able to read them so long as you know the other one.
1508 | 養う | やしなう | To Foster | To Raise\n To Develop\n To Cultivate | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means foster so the verb vocab version is to foster or to raise. This can also refer to fostering a skill or ability, so can also mean to develop or to cultivate. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're offering to raise some girl as your own. After the paperwork is over, you can finally say: "Yah, she now (やしな) is my kid!"
1509 | 受かる | うかる | To Get Accepted | To Succeed\n To Pass | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji 受 means accept and this verb is related. It means to get accepted, usually into something good like a university or a new job. It can also mean to succeed or to pass, often in the context of a test or an exam.\nThis is an intransitive verb, meaning it happens on its own. The かる ending is a hint, because verbs with かる as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.\nWatch out: whereas in English we'd say "to pass an exam", in Japanese it's 試験に受かる, or "to pass in an exam." That's why it's intransitive in Japanese, even though we might make it transitive in the English translation! \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. Here's a little mnemonic to help ya remember:\nTo get accepted into this program, you have to juggle unis (う)—yes, those spiky sea urchins! Handling uni is tough, but if you want to pass the test and get accepted, you've got to master the uni challenge.
1510 | 疲れる | つかれる | To Get Tired |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means tired, so the verb version means to get tired.\n疲れる refers to a physical or mental kind of tiredness, like you just worked out or studied a ton, but isn't used to describe sleepiness. \n For example, you're bound to get tired if you try to lift two cars (つか), right? So think about that as you learn this word's reading.
1511 | 温める | あたためる | To Heat Something Up | To Warm Something Up | You know that the kanji 温 means warm, and this verb is related. It means to heat something up or to warm something up. It's all about you doing something to another object to make it hot, like putting it in the microwave. \n The kanji reading is the same as 温かい. As long as you know that reading, you should be able to associate it with this word.\nJust like you can say あったかい for 温かい, people often say あっためる in conversation. The "official" reading is still あたためる, so when typing out the kanji or taking a test, try to stick to あたためる.
1512 | 手伝う | てつだう | To Help | To Assist\n To Lend A Hand | When you transmit your hand to something or someone, you're putting out your hand to help them or to assist them. \n Both of these are the kun'yomi readings that you've already learned! The thing is, the た from 伝's つた changes into だ for who knows what reason. Perhaps you can ask for someone to help you to understand this dumb reading change.
1513 | 想像する | そうぞうする | To Imagine |  | To imagine some sort of an image in your mind simply means to imagine. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1514 | 殺す | ころす | To Kill |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means kill so the verb vocab version is to kill. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You kill someone! Oh no, what are you going to do? Where will you put the body? You decide to stuff it into the core (ころ) of a nuclear silo. It will melt and disappear in there, right? At least, that's what you think. Imagine opening up the core of the nuclear silo and feel the burn of the radiation. You throw the body in and close the core, then run away. Unfortunately, this nuclear core will kill you too, eventually. Then, it will kill everyone in the area, because the body you threw in will overheat the core, causing a giant explosion.
1515 | 見返る | みかえる | To Look Back At | To Look Back On\n To Look Back | Your seeing is returning on something. This verb can be both transitive and intransitive. When it’s transitive, it means to look back at, in the sense of looking back at someone who’s behind you, or looking back at your past. When it’s intransitive, it simply means to look back, in the sense of looking over your shoulder. \n The readings are just 見 and the vocab word 返る, combined together. So long as you know both of those you should be able to combine them into the reading for this word.
1516 | 注文する | ちゅうもんする | To Order | To Request | You hopefully have seen the word 注文 (order, request). This is just the verb version: to order / to request. \n If you know the reading of 注文 you should be able to read this one too. Also, it's just all jukugo on'yomi readings, so you should be able to read it anyways.
1517 | 話題 | わだい | Topic | Subject | The topic that we are talking about is the topic that we are talking about. It's the subject of our conversation. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1518 | 追いかける | おいかける | To Chase | To Pursue\n To Run After\n To Follow | 追う means "to follow" or “to chase” and かける in this case means “to run,” so this word means to chase, to pursue, or to run after someone or something. \n The reading comes from 追う as well as the kanji reading you learned too.
1519 | 別れる | わかれる | To Separate | To Be Divided\n To Part From\n To Break Up | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means separate, so you can guess the meaning is to separate or to be divided. \n Remember the word 分ける? That word means "to separate" too. The reading is similar, though not the same, but we can at least use it as a jumping off point. We go from わける to わかれる. It's like we've "separated" the け and the る and combined them in the middle. け, making a かれ, which gets you to わかれる.
1520 | 共有する | きょうゆうする | To Share | To Own Jointly\n To Co Own | This is the same as 共有 but the verb version. \n The reading comes from 共有 as well as the readings you learned via the kanji.
1521 | 駅員 | えきいん | Train Station Employee | Train Station Staff\n Train Station Attendant\n Station Attendant\n Station Employee | A train station member is someone who works at the train station. They are a train station employee. Feel free to ask them if you need help knowing which direction to train in. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1522 | 天王星 | てんのうせい | Uranus |  | The heaven king star is the planet Uranus. Knowledge of Greek mythology will definitely help you here, because the English name is a reference to the Greek god of the skies, and the Japanese name is a direct translation of that! \n This is a jukugo word and uses the on'yomi, but over time the reading for 王 changed from おう to のう, to make it easier to pronounce. You'll still see that listed as an alternative reading in some dictionaries, but it's pretty much never used nowadays, so we'll only accept the てんのうせい reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\nWho predicted the discovery of Uranus? Nostradamus (のう), of course!
1523 | 俺たち | おれたち | We | Us | When たち is attached to a word referring to a person, it makes it plural. So, when you attach たち to 俺 (I), it means we or us.\nJust remember that 俺 is quite casual and rough sounding, so it's best to only use it with close friends (or when you're shaking someone down...). \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1524 | 能力 | のうりょく | Ability | Capability | Your ability power is what you can do. This is your ability. It is also your capability. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1525 | 約 | やく | About | Approximately | The kanji means promise, but the meaning of this word is about, which is a little different. Just think about promises. When you promise something you really need to follow through... but only about as much as you need to for the other person to be happy. Someone asks for a puppy for Christmas, and you get them a stuffed animal puppy. It's approximately the promise you made. Close enough. *wink* \n The reading for this is actually the same one that you learned with the kanji, so no need to memorize anything new!
1526 | 知り合い | しりあい | Acquaintance |  | You've probably seen the words 知る and 合う by now. This is someone you "know" because you have "come together" before, but that's pretty much it. You don't really know them well, you just met them a couple times so you know who they are. This person is an acquaintance. \n The readings are that of 知る and 合う. So long as you know those words, you should be able to read this one too.
1527 | 〜的 | てき | -al | -Like\n Typical Of | This is a strange word, I'm afraid. You'll have to bear with it. This, when added onto a word, is like adding an -al or a -like to the end of it—or when something is typical of something else. For example, add it onto 日本 (Japan) and you have "Japanese-like", or "typically Japanese". It's a weird sort of modifying word that really depends on each situation it's in. For now, just know this word means these things. We'll start applying it to various words in the future, slowly but surely. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, probably because this is usually added onto other words, making it behave like a jukugo.
1528 | 周年 | しゅうねん | Anniversary |  | When you wrap around the entire  circumference of the year you've come back around to the start of it. This is the anniversary.\nThis word is commonly used with numbers, like 10周年 (10th anniversary), or combined with other words, like 周年事業 (anniversary project). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1529 | 協会 | きょうかい | Association | Organization\n Society | When you meet for cooperation, you're coming together to help each other. One form of this is when people form associations. They're all cooperating and coming together to help each other and themselves. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1530 | 雰囲気 | ふんいき | Atmosphere | Ambience\n Ambiance\n Mood | The surrounding energy in the atmosphere is what makes up the atmosphere. I love it when it takes three kanji to represent what one of the three kanji already represents. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1531 | 自動 | じどう | Automatic |  | Something that can move by its self is something that's automatic. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1532 | 気持ち悪い | きもちわるい | Bad Feeling | Feeling Bad\n Feeling Terrible\n Unpleasant\n Gross | The 気持ち (feeling) is bad. So, you can imagine how you feel isn't good, it's a bad feeling. You're feeling terrible, in fact. \n The readings come from the words 気持ち and 悪い. Hopefully you've seen both and can combine them together to know the reading automatically. No bad feelings with this word, right?
1533 | 悪口 | わるぐち | Bad-Mouthing | Trash-Talk | Your bad mouth produces nothing but bad-mouthing and trash-talk.\n悪口 often targets someone's character, appearance, or abilities, with the intention of hurting them or damaging their reputation, sometimes to their face, but often behind their back. It gives rise to unfavorable information that can spread through gossip. \n The reading is the kun'yomi vocab readings for these two kanji, probably because this word is just two words put together into one (bad + mouth). Use your knowledge of the vocab words 悪い and 口 to learn the reading of this word.\nOkay, I lied. You should actually do わるぐち instead. わるくち is possible, but the rendaku version is way more common. Sorry to say such bad things before.
1534 | 骨 | ほね | Bone |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Take a look at your own bones. They have been upgraded with special technology, allowing you to hone (ほね) in on targets, then shoot your bones at them. Go ahead and imagine yourself using this crazy new bone technology. Wolverine is jealous.
1535 | 骨折 | こっせつ | Broken Bone | Fracture\n Bone Fracture | When your bone breaks, you end up with, well, a broken bone or fracture. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just watch out because こつ is shortened to こっ here.
1536 | 束 | たば | Bundle | Bunch | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You are counting your bundles. There are a lot of them, so you have to create tabs (たば) in your notebook to properly categorize everything. Imagine yourself doing this (physically creating the tabs in your notebook, even though your notebook didn't come with tabs).
1537 | 世話 | せわ | Care | Looking After | Older generations mostly talk about one thing: care. Everybody wants to receive care once they're older, don't they? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just remember that 世 is せ here, and not せい!
1538 | 人参 | にんじん | Carrot |  | What do you use to get a person to participate in something? A carrot, of course. You've heard of "the carrot and the stick," right? So next time you want a person to participate, offer them a carrot. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 参 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou're craving a carrot, but you can't seem to find any. You look in your fridge, in your garden, and even in the trash. Finally you give up your carrot search and sit down when... ouch! The carrot was in your jeans (じん) the whole time!
1539 | 場合 | ばあい | Case | Circumstance\n Situation | What location suits a situation the best? That always depends on the case or circumstance. You can't know the suitability of the location until you have all the facts about the circumstances. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji. You haven't learned this kun'yomi reading for 合 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nTo know exactly what case or circumstance you're dealing with, you keep a close eye (あい) on things. Imagine your eye really close up to the circumstances, trying to figuring out exactly what's going on.
1540 | 人格 | じんかく | Character | Personality | Your person status is where you, yourself, are a person. This is more than skin deep, though, this is your status after all. This is your character and personality. What's the status of your character? Good? Bad? Getting there? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1541 | 周り | まわり | Circumference | Perimeter\n Edge\n Surroundings\n Locality\n Neighborhood | This is the noun version of the kanji circumference, so it means circumference too. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou really want to measure the circumference of something but there doesn't seem to be anything round around. That's when you remember, "Mah Walnuts! (まわ)." The walnuts in your pocket have an easy edge to measure.
1542 | 芸人 | げいにん | Comedian | Performer\n Entertainer | What is the greatest art a person can possess? It’s got to be the art of making people laugh. That’s why this means comedian, though it can also mean a performer or entertainer more generally. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1543 | 完全 | かんぜん | Complete | Perfect\n Perfection\n Completeness | When something is all perfect it is complete. Not only that, but it's perfect (because it's ALL perfect, not just partially so). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1544 | 完成 | かんせい | Completion | Accomplishment | When something has become perfect it has reached completion. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1545 | 完了 | かんりょう | Completion | Complete\n Finish\n Conclusion | A perfect finish is when everything is at total completion. Nothing is left over and all is done. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1546 | 妥協 | だきょう | Compromise | Giving In | When you have gentle cooperation nobody has their way. You're very gently coming towards the middle, coming to a compromise. (Whether you like it or not.) \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1547 | 具合 | ぐあい | Condition | State\n Health | You have to find the right tool to suit your condition or state. If you have a health condition, the tool is a pill, or exercise, or real life friends. But it always depends on the condition you're in. \n This word consists of the on'yomi reading for 具 and the kun'yomi reading for 合. You've learned them both, so you should be able to read this word too!
1548 | 料理 | りょうり | Cooking | Cuisine\n Dish | There is a reason for this fee that you have to pay to get in here. We are cooking cuisine for you to eat while you're watching the show. If we weren't cooking a dish for you, we probably wouldn't charge you this fee! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1549 | 協力 | きょうりょく | Cooperation | Collaboration\n Assistance | Cooperation power is your level of cooperation. It's how much collaboration or assistance you provide. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1550 | 周期 | しゅうき | Cycle | Period | If you follow the circumference of a period of time, you end up back at the beginning and it makes a full cycle. Events in history always repeat, right? \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1551 | 明後日 | あさって | Day After Tomorrow |  | Things will be bright after the next day. Or you can think of it as adding an 後 in between your 明日. And what comes after tomorrow? It's the day after tomorrow. \n Unfortunately, the reading for this is a complete exception, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n"What do you want to eat the day after tomorrow?", your mom asks you. You answer, "Ah, satay (あさって)?" You're not so confident because you never know what you want to eat the day after tomorrow, but you absolutely love satay, the Indonesian skewers. Ah, satay it is!
1552 | 深さ | ふかさ | Depth | Profundity | This is the noun version of the kanji deep, so it means depth. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading when you learned 深い so you should be able to read this one too!
1553 | 願望 | がんぼう | Desire | Wish\n Aspiration | The hope you request is your desire. Just imagine yourself hoping and requesting some higher power for something you really want. What is this? It's your desire or wish. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1554 | 言葉つき | ことばつき | Diction | How One Speaks | Remember how 言葉 means "language?" Well, the way you "attach" (付き) language to things is your diction. Everyone has their own 言葉つき when they speak. How would you describe your 言葉つき?\n言葉つき refers to the characteristics of how one speaks, including the words they choose, how they say them, and their overall speaking style. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own.
1555 | 失望 | しつぼう | Disappointment | Despair | There is fault in your hope. It breaks, and everything falls apart. You feel massive disappointment and despair. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1556 | 消しゴム | けしごむ | Eraser | Rubber | You've seen the word 消す, I hope. This comes from that. You're extinguishing something with ゴム. ゴム is a word for either gummy or rubbery things. So, this is a gummy thing that extinguishes something. This is an eraser that extinguishes pencil markings. \n The reading comes from 消す, so make sure you know that word so you can read this one!
1557 | 皆様 | みなさま | Everyone | All\n Everybody | Everyone (formal name ender). This is just a polite way to say everyone (and you want to be polite to everyone, because everyone > you). \n The reading for both kanji here are the same as the ones you learned with their kanji. Everyone can breathe easier now.
1558 | 悪気 | わるぎ | Evil Intent | Malice\n Ill Will | Someone with bad energy is someone who has evil intent, malice, or ill will. Hopefully you don't have too much 悪気. \n The reading itself has a lot of 悪気 with all the exceptions it has. The 悪 part is read like 悪い. Then, 気 is rendaku'd. What an evil reading. Just think "what's the most evil reading I can come up with?" when you see this word. Then you should hopefully be able to read it.
1559 | 例文 | れいぶん | Example Sentence | Model Sentence\n Sample Sentence | Example writing is a piece of writing that is an example for maybe a word or a kanji or something like that. This is an example sentence. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1560 | 例外 | れいがい | Exception |  | Something that's outside the example doesn't follow the rules. It's not what it's supposed to be (the example), it is the exception. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1561 | 女性 | じょせい | Female | Woman\n Lady | Someone who's of the woman gender is probably going to be female. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1562 | 例えば | たとえば | For Example | For Instance\n Supposing That | This has almost the same meaning as the kanji it comes from. Instead of just simply being "example," though, it's for example. It can also sometimes mean supposing that when talking about hypothetical scenarios. So, supposing that I start a sentence with this, I can be all like "例えば, I am using 例えば in a sentence." \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Using all kinds of "for examples" like this, you were taught (たと) many things throughout your life. For example, you were taught about...
1563 | 基本 | きほん | Foundation | Basics | The origin of your foundation is where you have to work from when learning something new. For example, the 基本 portions of WaniKani are the earlier levels, especially the radicals. They are the foundation you need to learn your kanji and vocab later on. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1564 | 毛皮 | けがわ | Fur | Pelt\n Animal Fur | This word is pretty straightforward. You have fur and skin, making a word meaning fur or pelt, like the kind that can be used to make garments. \n This is a special case because both kanji use kun'yomi readings in this word. Luckily, you already know the kun'yomi reading from learning the vocabulary 毛 and 皮 previously. Just be careful with the rendaku on the second kanji, 皮.
1565 | 試合 | しあい | Game | Match | An attempt to join together isn't just any get together. Imagine two people boxing. They attempt to knock each other out when they join together. That's why this word is game or match. Did you watch the 試合 today? No! Don't tell me what happened, I recorded it on the VHS. \n This word uses the on'yomi し for 試 and the kun'yomi あい for 合, which you learned with 場合. So you should be able to put them together!
1566 | 芸者 | げいしゃ | Geisha |  | The arts are performed by someone. Who is that someone? Well, think about the reading for this kanji. Do you recognize the word? It's geisha. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1567 | 性 | せい | Gender | Nature\n Sex | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
1568 | 良好 | りょうこう | Good | Favorable\n Satisfactory | A good like is something you like really good, if that makes any sense. This thing is a good and favorable thing. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You've learned them already, so you should be able to read this on your own!
1569 | お疲れ様 | おつかれさま | Good Work | Thank You For Your Hard Work\n That's Enough For Today | You are a 疲れ (tired) 様 (honorific that kind of refers to whoever's being mentioned). You say this to people when they've done good work — at the end of a workday or after a hard practice, for example. I guess the idea is that if they're tired, they've done some good work. Tell your coworkers お疲れ様でした when they leave for the day, or just use お疲れ in more casual situations with friends! \n The reading comes from 疲れ and 様, combined together into one word.
1570 | 卒業 | そつぎょう | Graduation |  | The business of you graduating is your graduation. If you think about it, it's kind of a big business, getting you graduated from expensive schools. The graduation business focuses on graduations, and getting you there (hint: this business is a school, probably). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1571 | 固い | かたい | Hard | Tough\n Firm | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of hard? It's hard, firm, or tough. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou need something really hard to put in your catapult(かた). Look around you for something hard and imagine putting it in your catapult!
1572 | 念願 | ねんがん | Heart's Desire | Earnest Wish | What your thoughts request inside your head, nonstop like a crazy person, are your heart's desires. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1573 | 希望 | きぼう | Hope | Wish\n Aspiration | Both your hopes and wishes are held within this vocab word. So, what is the meaning of this word? It is both hope and wish. Either will work. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1574 | 消化不良 | しょうかふりょう | Indigestion |  | You've hopefully seen 消化 by now and know that it means "digestion." If you know that, then you can see that the "digestion" is not good. When your digestion is not good, what do you have? Indigestion. Excuse me, I have to run to the restroom... \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Knowing 消化 and 不良 will help as well.
1575 | 材料 | ざいりょう | Ingredients | Material | You have to pay a fee for the material you use to make food. Those are the ingredients you're paying for! Imagine making a list of all of the materials you need to make a stew, then making sure you have enough to pay the fees, so you'll have all the ingredients you need to make it. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1576 | 一例 | いちれい | Instance | Example | One example is just an instance of what you're describing. Just one example. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1577 | 本能 | ほんのう | Instinct |  | The abilities you originally start out with are instincts. Animals have lots of them because they aren't very good at learning. They have to start out knowing them from the start. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1578 | 意図的 | いとてき | Intentional | On Purpose | You wouldn't put your idea in a diagram ~like format if it wasn't intentional. Doing that takes a lot of work. So you can only make diagram like things on purpose! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 図 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou intentionally stub your toe (と) all the time! If you hurt your toe on purpose you can get out of class and work! It's a really simple injury, but you can't do other stuff while it's hurt, so you always do it on purpose to get out of things.
1579 | 着物 | きもの | Kimono | Clothes | The things you wear are your clothes. Oh, and Japanese clothes count too. We're talking kimonos. Way back when, these could just be called clothes because it's all people really wore, but nowadays we know they're specific to the stereotypical kimono you think of when you think "Japan." \n The reading is a bit strange using kun'yomi readings. Luckily, we taught you these already, so go put on that kimono of yours and relax at the 温泉 for a bit.
1580 | 行 | ぎょう | Line of Text | Line\n Row | You write the word go on a line of text. See the word "go" on that line, and think about where you're going.\nThis word can also be used for rows (horizontal lines in Excel and other spreadsheets). \n There are two on'yomi readings for this kanji, but when it's used to mean lines of text, it's pronounced as ぎょう. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember that:\nYou write out another line of text asking for some gyoza (ぎょう). You write out that line of text slowly and carefully, in your very best handwriting. Turns out you were going to a gyoza restaurant and you want to make sure you impress the gyoza chef, so that they give you a ton of gyoza.
1581 | 材木 | ざいもく | Lumber | Timber\n Wood | Lumber trees are what you use to make lumber and timber.\n材木 is typically for lumber or timber that's been processed — the stuff that's cut into planks and ready to use in your next DIY project, for example. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1582 | 本館 | ほんかん | Main Building | This Building | One of the meanings of 本 is main (which is what we're using here). The main public building is the main building.\nSometimes 本館 can also mean this building, as in the one you're in. I guess whatever building you're in sort of becomes the main one to you, right? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.\nFor you advanced learners out there, you might want to know that saying that this word like Kyoko gets you the main building meaning, while saying it like Kenichi gets you the this building meaning! Isn't pitch accent fun? But you'll probably never have to worry about this — context clues will be enough to tell you which meaning is being used.
1583 | 男性 | だんせい | Male | Man\n Guy | A man's gender is known as "male."\nNote that this can only refer to a human's gender; you're going to learn the word you use for animals, plants, etc. later on! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1584 | 意地悪 | いじわる | Malicious | Mean\n Jerk | A person whose ideas are grounded in evil is a malicious, mean jerk! \n This reading is a combination of the on'yomi readings for 意 and 地, and the kun'yomi reading for 悪. You've learned them all already, but since 地 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nMalicious, mean jerks get sent to Jesus (じ) to sort them out. If anyone can sort out those malicious jerks, it’s Jesus!
1585 | 近代的 | きんだいてき | Contemporary | Modern | Something that is near period like is very contemporary. But if it looks like it's from a period not near the one you're in... throw it away! It isn't modern enough to touch your hands! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1586 | 山登り | やまのぼり | Mountain Climbing |  | You've hopefully seen how 登る means "to climb." So, if you're climbing a mountain what is that? It's mountain climbing.\nIn case you're wondering what the difference is between this and 登山, they are essentially the same. The main difference is that 山登り is a little less formal, and is generally used as a standalone word, whereas 登山 can be used in compound words like 登山家 (mountaineer). \n The reading comes from combining 山 and 登る together to form one word, 山登り. If you know the readings of those two words you know the reading of this word too.
1587 | 動き | うごき | Movement | Activity\n Trend\n Development\n Change | This is the noun version of the kanji move. So it means movement. \n This is the same reading you learned from the word 動く. If you know that word, you know how to read this word!
1588 | 明らか | あきらか | Obvious | Clear\n Evident | When it's bright around, things become more obvious, clear and evident. \n Since this is a word that consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it uses kun'yomi. Unfortunately, 明 is a little tricky and has a few of those. So here's a mnemonic to help you remember this one:\nIt's obvious that all you need is a key (あき) to open this door. It's like, blatantly clear. The lock is right there. You really just need a key. Did you forget it? Of course you did…
1589 | 一周 | いっしゅう | One Time Around | Once Around\n One Lap | One circumference is one time around, or in racetrack sports, one lap. How many times will you go around the moon? Just 一周? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Note that the いち becomes いっ as it often does when being used in a counter (一階, 一回, etc.).
1590 | 開閉 | かいへい | Opening And Closing | Opening And Shutting | Opened and closed things are opening and closing. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1594 | 松 | まつ | Pine | Pine Tree | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, so no need to think too hard.
1595 | 松葉 | まつば | Pine Needle |  | The pine leaves are not really leaves, they're more like needles, thus making this word pine needle.\n松葉 is commonly used in compounds, such as 松葉ガニ (snow crab) or 松葉づえ (crutches). \n If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The 葉 gets rendaku'd to ば though, so watch out for that.
1596 | お願いします | おねがいします | Please Help Me | Please\n If You Would Be So Kind | This is a tricky word that doesn't really have a good translation. The best ways I've seen it done in terms of getting a meaning across are please and please help me. When you say this word you're kind of saying "please help me out and I'm relying on you and you're kind of awesome too." Anyways, please is a pretty good way to do it. So, when you see this word you'll notice it has the request kanji in it. You can guess you're requesting something. What is that thing? It's help (please help me) and you're asking very nicely too (please). \n You ask for help by saying please help me, and that person does try to help you... but the amount they do for you is so negligible that it hardly does anything to help you at all. Please try to help me again, this time better?
1597 | 流行語 | りゅうこうご | Popular Phrase | Catchphrase\n Popular Word\n Buzzword | You know that 流行 means "trend", so "trend" language means a popular phrase. Yolo! It could also be a catchphrase, a popular word, or a buzzword. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1598 | 流行歌 | りゅうこうか | Popular Song |  | You know that 流行 refers to a "trend." So, a "trend" song is a popular song. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1599 | 約束 | やくそく | Promise | Appointment\n Pact | A promise bundle is still a promise no matter how many you have wrapped up there.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1600 | 目的 | もくてき | Purpose | Goal\n Motive | When your eye is on the target you know your purpose. You also have your eye on the goal (that's the target, after all!). \n The reading is a reading for 目 that's abnormal. You've seen this reading with 目標 and 目次, though, so hopefully it won't be too hard at this point. Just imagine telling someone your 目的, only to have them laugh in your face and begin mocking もく you for it. Now you're not so sure if your goal is going to work.

1602 | 残り | のこり | Remainder | Remnant\n Leftover\n Residue | This has the same meaning as the kanji. The little り thrown on there is just a little remainder sticking off the end of the kanji. No need to pay attention to that. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're waiting inside. The remainder of your forces are out there, fighting. You don't know who will survive... or if they even will. You have a secret knock (のこ), though, that you use to find out if it's one of the remaining forces outside or the enemy, broken through. You hear a knock. What is it? Is it your men or theirs? Imagine it out, focusing on the knock conversation that happens between you and the remainder.
1603 | 予約 | よやく | Reservation | Appointment | A beforehand promise is a promise you've made beforehand. This is a reservation or appointment. Makes sense, right? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1604 | 回転ずし | かいてんずし | Rotating Sushi | Conveyor Belt Sushi\n Sushi Go Round | You know that 回転 is "rotation" and you probably know what すし is (gets rendaku'd in this word to ずし). So, what is "rotation sushi?" It's rotating sushi, also known as conveyor belt sushi. Look it up if you don't know what it is. \n The reading comes from 回転, so be sure to know that to know this one. Also, it's just the readings of the kanji you learned too, so shouldn't be too hard.
1605 | 文化祭 | ぶんかさい | School Festival | Culture Festival\n Arts Festival | Remember how 文化 means "culture?" Well add festival to it and you end up with a culture festival! These happen all the time at Japanese schools, so sometimes they're called school festivals too. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You've learned all of these readings already, good for you!
1606 | 性病 | せいびょう | Sexually Transmitted Disease | Std | A gender sickness is one you catch from *ahem* doing things with those of another or the same gender. You only catch these sicknesses this way, meaning they're sexually transmitted diseases (save yourself some typing and just answer with STD). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1607 | 格好 | かっこう | Shape | Form\n Posture\n Appearance | You like the status of what's in front of you. It has an excellent shape and form to it. Imagine something that would be pleasing to you in terms of its shape. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just be sure to note the かく reading, which gets changed to かっ.
1608 | 芸能界 | げいのうかい | Show Business | Entertainment Industry | The art ability world is the world of show business, or in other words, the entertainment industry.

That bone status is lookin' good on you! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just note that こつ changes to こっ.
1611 | 運動会 | うんどうかい | Sports Day |  | Remember how 運動 means "exercise?" When you meet with a bunch of other people to exercise it's called Sports Day! This is a day at schools in Japan where everybody does physical stuff together! It's fun and also very tiring! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1612 | 待ちぼうけ | まちぼうけ | Stood Up | Waiting In Vain | With 待ち you know you're waiting, but what's a ぼうけ? Turns out it's the long version of ボケ which means idiot. Basically, in this case you're a waiting idiot. Why? because you were stood up. \n The reading for 待ち comes right from 待つ. You know the drill by now.
1613 | 閉店 | へいてん | Store Closed | Closed Store\n Closing A Store\n Closing Down A Store | A closed shop is when a store's status is store closed or closed store. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1614 | 苺 | いちご | Strawberry |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this vocabulary is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji. Go eat some strawberries to celebrate!
1615 | 頑固 | がんこ | Stubborn |  | A hard stubborn person is very stubborn no matter how you look at them. Try to break through that hard stubbornness and all you'll find is more stubborn. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1616 | 水着 | みずぎ | Swimsuit | Bathing Suit\n Swimwear | Water wear is a swimsuit, bathing suit, or swimwear. \n The reading for this one is all kun'yomi vocab reading, but you should know these by now. 着 uses the reading you learned with the vocab word 着る, but this word employs that pesky rendaku, so remember that き becomes ぎ here.
1617 | 才能 | さいのう | Talent |  | A person who has great talent and ability has quite the talent. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1618 | 四季 | しき | The Four Seasons | Four Seasons | The four seasons are the four seasons. For some reason many Japanese people think that Japan's the only place with four distinct seasons. Obviously they haven't been to half the places on their latitude around the world. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Note that 四 is read using the on'yomi reading, which you've seen a few times over the course of WaniKani. Think of し meaning "death" (like 死), and how with the four seasons there comes death every Fall and Winter.
1619 | 整理する | せいりする | To Arrange | To Organize\n To Sort | When you arrange something with reason you're arranging it. That's why this is to arrange. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1620 | 間に合う | まにあう | To Be In Time For | To Make It On Time\n To Be On Time For | There is an interval (of time) that you need "to suit" (合う). To suit that interval, you need to be there before the time in question. That's why this word means to be in time for, to make it on time or to be on time for. \n You learned this reading for 間 when you learned 間もなく. And the reading for 合う is just that of the word 合う. If you remember them both, you'll remember this word!
1621 | 落ち着く | おちつく | To Calm Down |  | Hey. Drop yourself down and arrive back to me. You're going nuts over there. Lower down. Come back. Arrive. You need to do these things to calm down. \n The readings come from 落ちる and 着く. Hopefully you know these words so you can read this word as well! If you don't, just 落ち着く and everything will be okay.
1622 | 参る | まいる | To Come | To Go\n To Visit\n To Be Defeated\n To Be At A Loss | The kanji itself means participate, so you'd think this word would mean "to participate" but it's a little more complex than that. Think of it as "to participate" but where you have to come or to go in order to do it. This is the humble way to say those things, so you're going to these places with your tail between your legs, just happy you can participate more than anything. By extension, this is also a humble way to say to visit, often used if you're visiting something sacred like a shrine or a tomb.\nHistorically, this word arose as a humble way to indicate visiting a person of higher social status. In a weird twist, this word has come to also mean to be defeated or to be at a loss. Think of it as what can happen when you're trying to participate while in an inferior position to someone or something. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You get to come to participate! "It's my (まい) lucky day!" you exclaim.
1623 | 消化する | しょうかする | To Digest | To Use Up | You know how 消化 is "digestion"? Well, The verb form of that is this word, which is to digest. \n If you know 消化 you should be able to read this. Also, it uses the readings you learned with the kanji anyways, so no problemo there.
1624 | 消える | きえる | To Disappear | To Go Out\n To Turn Off | You've seen that 消す is "to extinguish." So, this is another verb version of that. This time, you're not doing the extinguishing, it's just happening. Something is going to disappear on its own. How can you differentiate this from 消す? Well, える allows you to notice how the object disappeared into thin air (える). You know you didn't do it, so it disappeared on its own, making it to disappear. \n The reading is different from 消す, unfortunately, so you can't use that. Just think about how after the object in front of you disappears you use a key (き) to open an invisible door. That's where everything's disappearing to! You see all your disappeared stuff on the other side of this invisible door which you opened with a magical key.
1625 | 期待する | きたいする | To Expect | To Anticipate | Hopefully you know the word 期待 by now (expectation). This is the verb version, which makes it to expect. \n The reading comes from the word 期待, so make sure you know that to know this one as well.
1626 | 折る | おる | To Fold Something | To Break Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means fold or break, so the vocab verb version is to fold something or to break something \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You fold your obi (お) really carefully and put it away with the rest of your kimono.
1627 | 合わせる | あわせる | To Join Together | To Unify\n To Match | You know that the alternative kanji meaning for 合 is join, which is what we're using here. The verb form of join is to join together, and it can also mean to unify and to match. \n The reading comes from 合う, so if you know that reading you'll know this reading as well.
1628 | 待たせる | またせる | To Make Someone Wait | To Keep Someone Waiting | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means wait so this word has something to do with waiting. Use the たせ as a hint. Someone "tossed" a ball off into a ditch, and then they had to find it. They made you wait for them to get the ball too, even though it's a cheap piece of crap. Feel upset about this. That'll help you remember that this means to make someone wait and to keep someone waiting. \n You learned this reading from 待つ, congrats!
1629 | 動かす | うごかす | To Move Something |  | You've seen 動く hopefully, and know it means to move. This is similar to that, but now you're moving something else. You know this because as you go to move something the thing you're moving starts to cuss (かす) you out because it's angry. \n The reading for this can come from 動く. If you know that word, you know how to read this word!
1630 | 残念 | ざんねん | Too Bad | Unfortunate\n Regrettable\n Disappointing | The remainder of your thoughts are very small. You've thought of everything you possibly can to solve this problem. In the end, the remainder of your thoughts is left with one phrase: "too bad." There's nothing else to think but the remainder. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1631 | 合格する | ごうかくする | To Pass A Test | To Pass An Exam | The status joins together. Think of this like a bunch of status messages on Facebook, all coming together at the same time. A big government test has just finished. Everyone's status' are joining on Facebook together to say they passed, showing to pass a test. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1632 | 着ける | つける | To Put On | To Wear | Another verb for this kanji! Crazy! I know, I'm sorry. The previous ones were: 着る (to wear), 着く (to arrive), and now 着ける (to put on / to wear). At least it's similar to 着る, right? In this case, this word is like 付ける, which means "to attach." It's used for things you "attach" to your body to wear, like accessories, or a face mask. That's why this is to put on or to wear. Same sound, different kanji, similar ideas. \n The reading is the same as 着く's reading, but it might be easier to think it shares a reading with 付ける, which has a similar meaning. Put on clothes, attach on clothes, etc.
1633 | 残る | のこる | To Remain Behind | To Remain\n To Stay Behind | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means remainder, so the verb vocab version is "to remainder." Let's make that sound better: to remain behind. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You decide to remain behind. Everyone else leaves, and you think you're alone. Then, someone knocks (のこ) on the door. Your heart jumps in your throat. They knock again.
1634 | 回転する | かいてんする | To Rotate | To Revolve | You know that 回転 means "rotation" or "revolution." So, what happens when you make it into a verb? It becomes to rotate and to revolve. \n The reading comes from 回転 of level 10. Alternatively, you can just use the readings of the kanji as well. EZPZ.
1635 | 流れる | ながれる | To Stream | To Flow | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means stream? It's to stream (though it's also to flow, a very similar word). You can differentiate this from 流す because with 流す you flush something down the toilet, which causes it to overflow so you sue (す) the toilet maker. With 流れる you find a rare (れる) jewel trying to flow down the river. You grab it, and see it's a rare diamond! \n The reading is the same as 流す. So long as you know that you should be able to read this one as well!
1636 | 勉強する | べんきょうする | To Study |  | You've seen 勉強 (study) by now, right? Well, this is the verb version of that. This is to study. \n The reading is the same as 勉強. It's also the readings you learned with these kanji.
1637 | 囲む | かこむ | To Surround | To Enclose | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means surround so the verb vocab version is to surround or to enclose. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nPeople surround you. They circle around you, calling you a chicken. "Cacko! (かこ) Cacko! Cacko!" Wait, this isn't the sound a chicken makes, right? You laugh at them, thinking their way of making a chicken noise is weird. Go ahead and join in with them and say "Cacko" with them as well.
1638 | 旅行する | りょこうする | To Travel | To Take A Trip | You've hopefully seen 旅行 by this point. This is the verb version of that. Instead of "trip" it's to travel or to take a trip. These are fun to do. You should do them! \n The reading is the same as 旅行, but it also happens to use the reading you learned with the kanji anyways, so you should be able to read it.
1639 | 起こす | おこす | To Wake Someone Up | To Cause Something | You've seen 起きる which is "to wake up." This is similar, except you are waking someone else up, which makes the meaning of this word to wake someone up. How do you differentiate between this and 起きる? Because of the す on the end. You wake someone up violently, wrenching their neck. They turn around and sue (す) you, making you wish you never woke them up.\nThis can also mean to cause something. I guess if you wake someone up and they're not a morning person, you could cause something... like trouble. \n The reading is the same as 起きる, so as long as you know that word you should be able to read this one. Of course, you can also imagine them yelling "OH!" when you shake them awake too, if that helps.
1640 | 温まる | あたたまる | To Warm Up | To Get Warm | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends in an う sound, you know this word is a verb. More specifically, this verb ends in まる, and most verbs with this ending are intransitive, meaning the action or change happens on its own.\nThe kanji 温 means warm. So this verb means to get warm or to warm up. To help you distinguish this from 温める, you could think of a circle (まる) rolling down a hill all by itself, and getting warmer and warmer as it picks up speed. \n The kanji reading is the same as 温かい and 温める.
1641 | 望む | のぞむ | To Wish | To Desire\n To Wish For | If you have a hope and you turn it into a verb, you'd think it would be "to hope." But what is really behind a hope? It's a desire or wish, right? That's why this word means to wish or to desire. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Your one wish that you have is to have a bigger nose (のぞ). Feel your nose, it's too small. You wish it was two or three inches longer. Of course, if it helps to imagine you want a smaller nose or a nose at all, that's fine too. Just make sure you wish you have something nose-related.
1642 | 旅行者 | りょこうしゃ | Traveler | Tourist | You've seen that 旅行 is "trip." So who is someone who goes on trips? That is a tourist or traveler. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help if you know the reading of 旅行 already.
1643 | 下着 | したぎ | Underwear |  | The things you wear below your other clothes. That is your underwear. You do wear underwear, right? \n The reading for this one is all kun'yomi vocab reading, but you should know these by now. 着 uses the reading you learned with 着る, but this word employs that pesky rendaku, so remember that き becomes ぎ here.
1644 | 日本的 | にほんてき | Very Japanese | Typically Japanese | Things that are targeted as Japanese are more than just Japanese, they are very Japanese. This word may be hard to understand at first, but there are many things the Japanese consider to be Japanese-only. These theories range from reasonable to ridiculous, but either way, you'll see them described as 日本的. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help if you know how to read 日本 as well.
1645 | 待合 | まちあい | Waiting Room | Meeting Place | The place you wait to join other people is a waiting room or a meeting place. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings, but it's like the hiragana that normally sticks out is stuffed in. 待ち → 待, 合い → 合 and is pronounced the same too. I know it's confusing, but once you get it down you'll never forget!
1646 | 俺ら | おれら | We |  | I with a ら on it makes it plural. It's less formal than 俺たち (if you've seen that word yet), but has the same meaning. It's we. \n The reading is the same as the kanji's reading.
1647 | 井戸 | いど | Well |  | A well door is just a well. It's the door that goes into the well hole, making it a well. \n This kanji uses the kun'yomi readings for each kanji, for some reason. You learned the kun'yomi reading for both of these kanji as their primary readings already, just watch out for 戸 getting rendaku'd so it becomes ど instead of と.
1648 | 狼男 | おおかみおとこ | Werewolf |  | What’s another word for a wolf man? A werewolf, obviously. \n You learned the reading for 狼 in both the kanji and the vocabulary word. The reading for 男 comes from the vocabulary 男. Put them together and you get おおかみおとこ. Awoooo.
1649 | 望み | のぞみ | Wish | Hope\n Desire | A hope is really a wish that you have inside of you (though it can still be a hope too). \n What's your one big wish? It's to have a different nose (のぞ). Alternatively, you could think "nose on me" for のぞみ.
1650 | 折角 | せっかく | With Trouble | Valuable\n Precious\n Rare | When there's nothing but folds and angles, you have quite a mess. This word means with trouble because you certainly aren't traversing along a nice, flat piece of space-time, are you? Nah, it's all angled and folded.\n折角 is one of those tricky Japanese words that doesn’t have one neat translation in English. The nuance is that something has come about with trouble, either through someone’s efforts, or a stroke of luck.

It’s also used to underline a rare chance that shouldn’t be missed. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Watch out for the せつ changing to せっ, though. Another thing you have to go through with trouble, I'm afraid.
1651 | 狼 | おおかみ | Wolf |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this vocabulary is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji.
1652 | 木材 | もくざい | Wood | Lumber | Wood that is lumber is lumber wood.\nTechnically speaking, 木材 is used more for lumber or wood that hasn't been processed yet — less like planks, more like freshly cut lumber still lying on the forest floor. But it's not a hard rule or anything, so don't worry too much about the nuances. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1653 | 飲み放題 | のみほうだい | All You Can Drink |  | Drinking as much as you want is nice and all, but don't get sick. When you see this word, you know you're at an all you can drink place.

1656 | お願い | おねがい | A Request | Request\n Wish\n Please | The noun form of request (don't be tricked by the い on the end, it's not an adjective). So, request goes to a request. \n The reading is the same like お願いします. Hopefully you're able to read that by now so you're able to read this too.

This can also mean lunch, especially when used with the honorific prefix お, as in お昼. \n The reading for this word is the same as the kanji it comes from, so you should be able to read it!
1711 | オノマトペ | オノマトペ | Onomatopoeia | Mimetic Word | オノマトペ comes from the French word “onomatopée” which, as you can probably guess, means onomatopoeia.\nオノマトペ has a wider meaning than its English equivalent, and it also covers mimetic words, which are words that evoke ideas and actions rather than sounds.
1712 | 由来 | ゆらい | Origin | Source\n Coming From | What's the reason that something comes into being? Its origin, of course. Nothing can come into the world without a source, because it's always coming from somewhere. \n You didn't learn this reading for 由 so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThe best way to get close to the origin or source of something is to move into a yurt (ゆ). Yurts are easy to move around, so you can always get close to the source, wherever that may be.
1713 | 相手 | あいて | Partner | Companion\n Opponent | Remember how 手 can mean a "doer"? Now, what do you think your mutual doer might be? It’s someone who shares the same activities or tasks with you. This person could be your partner, companion, or even an opponent in certain situations. \n The readings are the kun'yomi readings. For 手, that's no problem for you. For 相, that's more of an issue since you learned the on'yomi reading for it. Think of it this way:\nYour partner wouldn't be your partner without you. Your partner is: I (あい) and you. Remember that as you gaze into your partner's eyes. "I and you."
1714 | 乗客 | じょうきゃく | Passenger |  | If you take a ride as a guest (or a customer), that makes you a passenger. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You hopefully learned the on'yomi for 乗 with the word 乗馬, but here's a mnemonic to help you just in case:\nYou notice a passenger getting on at your stop. Who is it? The distinct smell of barn animals and manure gives it away immediately: it’s Joe (じょう), the farmhand!
1715 | 計画 | けいかく | Plan | Planning\n Project | You need measurements and images to make a plan. You can't follow a plan without measurements and images to refer to, right? Any good plan has measurements and drawings. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The reading for 画 is the secondary reading though (かく), so take note of that.
1716 | 毒 | どく | Poison |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this word is the same as the kanji's reading.
1717 | 毒ガス | どくがす | Poison Gas |  | Poison Gas is a nasty thing. It is poison gas. \n The reading is the same as the kanji it comes from. The ガス is of course "gas."
1718 | 中毒 | ちゅうどく | Poisoning | Addiction | You're in the middle of poison, meaning you have poisoning. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

1720 | 比例 | ひれい | Being Proportional | Proportion | You compare examples, trying to figure out in which way they're being proportional. You know these examples you're comparing are in proportion to one another, you just need to figure out how.\nUse 比例 when talking about how one thing changes in proportion to another. Like the price of a good in proportion to its supply and demand, for instance. Check out our common word combinations and context sentences for some examples! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1721 | 返信 | へんしん | Reply | Answer | You gotta believe it will return. What are you believing in returning? The reply. You made a request for something (come up with something you want really bad but have to ask for). Now you wait for the reply. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1722 | 指輪 | ゆびわ | Ring |  | A finger ring is the kind of ring you'd put on your finger. That's just simply a "ring" though, so you'll have to know what "ring" this is via context. \n The readings come from the individual vocab readings, 指 and 輪. In English we don't distinguish some other ring from a "finger ring" but in Japanese, you can think of this as two separate words coming together to form one word, which is why it uses the kun'yomi vocab readings like this. So, if you know the individual words, you should be able to figure out this word is read as ゆびわ.
1723 | 輪ゴム | わごむ | Rubber Band | Elastic Band | A ring of gum (ゴム) (which is what Japanese people call rubber quite often) is a ring of rubber. What is a ring of rubber that people use often? It's a rubber band. \n The reading for 輪 is the kun'yomi vocab reading, which is わ, making this word わゴム.
1724 | 大変 | たいへん | Serious | Terrible\n Very\n Difficult\n Hard\n Hectic | A big change is a really serious thing. And people don't like change, either, making it a terrible event.\nAlso, in more recent history this has come to mean very as well. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1725 | 浅い | あさい | Shallow |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of shallow? It's shallow. \n The reading is the one you learned with the kanji, making this あさい
1726 | 単に | たんに | Simply | Merely\n Only | If you're moving towards (に) simple, you're saying simply, merely, or only. \n If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

1732 | 初耳 | はつみみ | Something Heard For The First Time | News | The first time something reaches your ear, it's something heard for the first time. If it's never entered your ear before, it's news to you! \n This is a jukugo word that uses kun'yomi instead of on'yomi readings, because 初 behaves more like a prefix here. You already know how to read 耳, but you haven't learned the kun'yomi for 初 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\nWhatever it is, this something heard for the first time, be sure to hold onto your hats (はつ)! It's going to be something big, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be news to me, too.
1733 | 特技 | とくぎ | Specialty |  | Your special skill is your specialty. So, what is your 特技? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

1735 | 春休み | はるやすみ | Spring Break | Spring Vacation\n Spring Holiday | You've seen 夏休み and 冬休み. If that isn't enough, you can see that this is a spring rest of some kind. That would be a spring break or spring vacation. \n The reading for 春 is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. The 休み part is the same as the vocab word 休み, which hopefully you can read! If you know those readings, you can read this too.
1736 | 変 | へん | Strange | Weird | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is more the "strange" meaning though, not the "change" one. As in, you 変な猫！ \n The reading is the one you learned with the kanji. How strange! Or not.
1737 | 丈夫 | じょうぶ | Sturdy | Firm\n Healthy | With the height of my husband, he's very firm. Try to push him over. Impossible. He's so tall and sturdy due to his height. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Watch out for the rendaku.
1738 | 同期中 | どうきちゅう | Syncing | Synchronizing | You're making things in two different places be exactly the same for a period of time. You're in the middle of a process called syncing. You can see 同期中 a lot in computery contexts, or if you change your device language to Japanese. (Not that I recommend that...) \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1739 | 美味しい | おいしい | Tasty | Delicious | Something with a beauty taste is something that is really tasty or delicious. Mmmm, yum!\nWhile 美味しい mostly describes tasty food, you may also occasionally see it being used for a sweet deal or situation that benefits you. \n The reading for this makes no sense at all. You'll have to learn it straight up, that is, unless you know the word おいしい already, which many people do as it's used in every other sentence in every Japanese variety show. If you don't know this word already, just think of yourself eating something delicious. It's so delicious it makes you mad, I have no idea why. You yell at the chef: "OI (おい). OI! WHY IS THIS SO DELICIOUS????"
1740 | 技 | わざ | Technique | Art\n Skill | What is a skill? It's something you can do, and do quite well. It is a technique that you can make happen with ease. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You do your technique on a bad guy, coming at you. You flip him over and knock him out. He was (わざ) a threat, but now he's not. You look closer at the bad guy. Turns out it's Woz, the Apple Co-founder. He was just trying to hand you an iPhone12, not grab your wrist. Whoops!
1741 | 寺 | てら | Temple |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the kanji too! You must have been praying to the kanji Gods at the local お寺.
1742 | 昨今 | さっこん | These Days | Nowadays\n Recently | Previous from now are the times around now. They're these days, nowadays, or recently. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just note that さく changes to さっ as many K-column sounds do in situations like this.
1743 | 受け入れる | うけいれる | To Accept Something | To Take In | Remember 受ける (to receive something) and 入れる (to put in)? This just combines those two. You receive something, and put it into your heart. You accept it. So this verb means to accept something or to take in.\nYou can use this verb for all kinds of acceptance, such as accepting an apology, accepting exchange students to your school, etc. \n You should know how to read both 受ける and 入れる, so you should be good to go!
1744 | 整える | ととのえる | To Arrange | To Put In Order | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means arrange, and the verb version also means to arrange or to put in order. This has to do with putting things in their rightful place, getting affairs in order, or even preparing equipment. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nEverything in your room has finally been put in order. Just as you finish, you hear a crash and turn to see your dog has jumped up onto your desk. "Toto no (ととの)!" you yell as he knocks everything over. Guess you have  to arrange  it all over again. Dammit Toto.
1745 | 好む | このむ | To Be Fond Of | To Like | You know that 好き is "like." Although 好き is kind of like a verb already, this is definitely a verb. It can be to be fond of or to like. \n The reading is a strange one, different from anything you've learned, kanji on'yomi or vocab kun'yomi. The reading is この, so think of this:\nWhat’s something easy to be fond of? 子? No (この), not for you. You’re always saying “子? No!” Most people are fond of kids, at least their own, but not you. Noisy, germy, needy 子? No, no thank you!
1746 | 信じる | しんじる | To Believe | To Trust In | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means believe so the verb vocab version is to believe. \n The reading for 信 is しん no matter what! See, if you believe, good things will happen. You should be able to read this.
1747 | 変える | かえる | To Change Something | To Change | The kanji is change, and this verb is to change something. If you change one thing for another thing, you are going to change it, after all. This word refers to changing one thing for a similar thing.\n変える and 代える sound the same and are sometimes used in similar contexts, but are different in nuance. 変える refers to the act of making something different, and involves altering the nature or state of something. For example, changing the layout of a room or changing one's perspective on an issue. 代える means to substitute or exchange one thing for another that is expected to fulfill the same role, use or purpose, such as replacing a worker with a substitute. \n This word uses the kun'yomi, which you didn't learn with the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you out.\nI don't like this car. I would like to change it for another car (か).
1748 | 晴れる | はれる | To Clear Up | To Become Sunny | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means clear up, so the verb vocab version is to clear up. It also means to become sunny as well. \n The reading you learned with the kanji is the one you use here. One of those words where the kun'yomi's going to be more useful.
1749 | 泣く | なく | To Cry |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means cry so the verb vocab version is to cry. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. If you remember the kanji reading you'll have no problem with this word.
1750 | 外す | はずす | To Disconnect Something | To Miss Something\n To Exclude Something\n To Remove Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji 外 means outside, and the meaning of this verb is somewhat related. It means to disconnect something. Think of it like this, if you disconnect a plug from a socket, you are taking the plug "outside" of the socket, right? Depending on the context, this verb can also mean to miss something (like the target during archery practice), to remove something, or to exclude something.\nThis is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You disconnect something, like a plug, or remove something, like your dog's leash. It's worth mentioning that most verbs ending in す are transitive, so you'll start seeing this pattern as you learn more! \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be a kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this one yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nIf you're going to disconnect something, it has (はず) to be the right thing! Don't go disconnecting the wrong plug, you'll cause no end of trouble!
1751 | 疑う | うたがう | To Doubt | To Suspect\n To Be Suspicious Of | The kanji means doubt, so this is just that as a verb. So this means to doubt, to suspect, or to be suspicious of. \n There's reason to doubt that you can teach an uni Tagalog (うたが), but once you try, it's actually not that hard. They're very good listeners after all.
1752 | 放つ | はなつ | To Fire | To Hit\n To Emit\n To Set Free\n To Break Wind | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. You already learned the verbs 放す and 放れる but this one is a little different. This is a specific kind of releasing. It means to fire an arrow, to hit a baseball, or to emit light. It even works when you're releasing a fart. Yes, it means to break wind too. What a great word! \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already so you should be able to read it!
1753 | 下りる | おりる | To Go Down | To Descend\n To Be Issued | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means below, which is a clue to the direction this movement verb takes: this is to go down or to descend. In some cases, this can also mean to be issued, mostly in situations where some sort of grant or allowance is issued by an authority.\nYou might notice that this is similar to 下る (くだる), and you can use either to describe going down a mountain. The difference is that 下る implies a gradual sloping motion, like floating down a stream, whereas you'd say 下りる if you’re jumping out of trees! \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou're stuck on a huge mountain, and the only way to go down is by using your obi (お). So you'll have to descend this entire mountain with nothing but your obi, acting as a rope. Good luck!
1754 | 暗記する | あんきする | To Memorize |  | Hopefully you've seen 暗記 before now. It means "memorization." So, turn that into a verb and you have to memorize. \n The reading comes from 暗記. It also is the reading you learned with the kanji too.
1755 | 払う | はらう | To Pay | To Brush Off | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means pay so the verb vocab version is to pay.\nThis word also means to brush off, like when you brush dirt or dust off of something. \n The reading comes from the one you learned with the kanji.
1756 | 練習する | れんしゅうする | To Practice |  | You've hopefully seen 練習, which means "practice." So, if you make it into a verb, you have to practice. \n The reading comes from the kanji as well as from the vocab word 練習. You should be able to read this!
1757 | 帰る | かえる | To Return Home | To Return\n To Go Home | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means return home so the verb vocab version is to return home, to return, or to go home. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. You can return home happily, knowing how to read this word!\nThis word has a pair verb though, so you'll want to remember the る ending. Just imagine how rude (る) it is when someone goes home without saying goodbye. The nerve!
1758 | 見返す | みかえす | To Show Someone What One Can Do | To Show Someone\n To Look Back Over Something\n To Return Someone’s Stare | When you see someone doubting you and return something successful instead, that is to show someone what one can do or more simply to show someone. In other words, you show someone who doubted you or treated you unfairly what you’re really capable of.\nThere are a couple of other meanings, too. It can mean to look back over something, like the answers to your kanji test you want to double check, and sometimes to return someone’s stare. You can see how all of these meanings relate to the kanji, right? \n The readings are from the words 見 and 返す put together.
1759 | 合計 | ごうけい | Total | Sum | When you join all your measurements together you have yourself a total. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1760 | 信号 | しんごう | Traffic Light | Signal\n Traffic Signal\n Stoplight\n Semaphore | If you believe in the numbers, there will be no traffic because the traffic light will be functioning properly. Traffic lights are based all off of traffic data and numbers. You just have to believe and hope it all works out in terms of these traffic lights. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1761 | 信用 | しんよう | Trust | Confidence | Your task is to believe. In order to do that, you have to have plenty of trust in what you believe in... not to mention confidence. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1762 | 変事 | へんじ | Unexpected Incident | Unusual Incident | You know 変 means "change," but it can also mean "strange." So a strange occurrence is an incident that is unlikely. In other words, an unexpected incident or an unusual incident.\n変事 is a formal word used to describe sudden and unusual occurrences that disrupt normal conditions, such as natural disasters, emergencies, or crises. You won't see this word often, but may still come across it in formal writing.\nWith 変事, think of how the 変 comes first to emphasize the strangeness of the incident. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1763 | 変死 | へんし | Unnatural Death | Accidental Death | A strange death is one that doesn't seem right. It's an unnatural death, and probably an accidental death (ie wasn't caused by natural causes). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1764 | 様々 | さまざま | Various |  | This one's kinda tricky. You learned 様 is a "formal name ender," but it can also mean "manner," as in the manner you do something in. So if you've got multiple manners, you've got lots of various ways of doing things! \n The reading is just the reading you learned with the kanji. The second one is ざま however, which plays right into the "various" meaning of the word. There's even various ways to read さま in this word!
1765 | 時計 | とけい | Watch | Clock | A thing that gives you time measurements is a watch or clock. Most people have these in their phones instead of on their wrists now. \n The reading for this is pretty weird. 計 is all nice and normal, but 時 is と for some reason. It probably is coming from the vocab word 時 (とき), is my guess. But even if it is, it's shortened, making it a step more complicated. Maybe it's just better to imagine that your watch is a walky talky (とけい) and run with that?
1766 | 単語 | たんご | Word | Vocabulary | The simple bits of language are the individual words. If you think about it, this is true. First of all, there are a ton of them. Second, they're tiny. They're just little bits of language and the "word" for these little bits is word.\nSo what’s the difference between this and 言葉? Well, 言葉 can cover any meaningful set of words – anything from words, sentences and paragraphs, to whole texts and even languages. 単語, on the other hand, is a subset of 言葉 that specifically refers to single, distinct words. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1767 | 作家 | さっか | Writer | Author\n Creator | This is a strange one, but only at first glance. You make a house. You'd think this would mean something like "building a house" or "construction" or something. Instead, it means writer. Think of it this way: A writer makes (writes and creates works) in their home. Writers don't make their word magic in a corporate office!\n作家 is generally used to refer to someone who writes professionally as an occupation, especially in the field of literature. It can also be used more broadly to refer to a creator who produces individual works of art or craft. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since the さく reading of 作 becomes さっ here, we've made a mnemonic for you to remember this reading:\nWriters love soccer (さっか). In fact, playing soccer is how they get their inspiration. Try playing some soccer, maybe you'll become a creator too!
1768 | 昨日 | きのう | Yesterday |  | The yesterday day is yesterday. What a blast from the past! \n Oof. The reading for this word makes no sense. You'll have to forget everything you've learned about the readings of the kanji and just go straight up mnemonic for the word on its own. Okay. Think about what you did yesterday, all day. You played keno (きのう), gambling away your grandmother's money. Yesterday was the worst day ever because you lost everything playing Keno. Today is different, not like yesterday, right?
1769 | 留守 | るす | Absence | Away From Home | You have gotten a mission. You must go out and detain a dangerous criminal to protect your country. While you go do that, you will be away from home and have an absence from society. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1770 | 料理人 | りょうりにん | A Cook | Cook\n Chef | You've seen 料理 and probably know it means "cooking." So, what is a person who does cooking? That is a cook or chef. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1771 | 入門 | にゅうもん | Admission | Entrance\n Introduction\n Apprenticeship | If you are able to enter the gate then you have gained admission and entrance to the facility.  Sometimes you do this to start an apprenticeship, where you get an introduction to some sweet new skills, like how to make an entrance. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1772 | 冒険 | ぼうけん | Adventure |  | You dare to do something risky. It's adventure time! Imagine yourself daring yourself to do risky things. Is this an adventure? If not, make it so! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1773 | 記念日 | きねんび | Anniversary | Memorial Day | You should write down all your thoughts on this day, because it's not just any day — it's an anniversary!\nWondering how 記念日 differs from 周年? 周年 is usually for a numbered anniversary, like 十周年 (10th anniversary), whereas 記念日 refers to the specific date on which a memorable event took place in the past. \n The reading is a combination of on'yomi for the first two and kun'yomi for the last one. That being said, all of the readings for all of the kanji are the readings you've learned already, so you should be able to read this word too. Just watch out because ひ is rendaku'd into び.
1774 | 品 | しな | Article | Item\n Goods | This is the same as the kanji, at least in regards to the article or goods meaning, which means you can use this word to mean article or goods. \n When this kanji is used as a single-character vocabulary word, it is usually read as しな. You'll see it read as ひん more often in kanji combination words. That said, there is an expression, 品がない, which means "unrefined" or "lacking taste," and the kanji is read ひん in this case. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember the しな reading:\nThink of it like a video game. The first time you see new goods there's a sheen (しな) about it. But when you bring it back to your place, the sheen is gone. Then when you go back to the store, wow! All the goods you don't already own have that sheen! Gotta buy them!
1775 | 芸術家 | げいじゅつか | Artist |  | You know that 芸術 is art so you'd think that 芸術家 would be something like "art house." Well, it's not. Think of it this way: Who is the person who works for "House Art"? It's the artist. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1776 | 自動的 | じどうてき | Automatic |  | An automatical (自動 + 的) thing of course isn't "automatical." A better way to say it is to cut off the -al and call it automatic. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know the reading of 自動 as well.
1777 | 自動車 | じどうしゃ | Automobile | Car | You know that 自動 is automatic. So what is an automatic car? That is an automobile, or simply a car. \n The reading comes from 自動 and the kanji 車's readings, combined.
1778 | 作品 | さくひん | A Work | Work\n Production | If you make a product, it's not really a product anymore, but a work. It's your work of art or literature, or maybe a theater production.\nThis can be any kind of artistic creation: a book, a composition, a painting, a movie, a play... It doesn't mean "product" (you'll learn the word for that later!) but it can be used for a product when you want to highlight the artistic talent behind it. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1779 | 弁当 | べんとう | Bento | Box Lunch | You know how 弁 means dialect and 当 means success? Well, this isn't going to help you much, because this means bento or box lunch. Chances are, though, you know the word "bento" from English. So, if you read this word (which you should be able to) you can figure out it's べんとう. If you do that, you can realize this word means bento too! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1780 | 箱 | はこ | Box |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
1781 | 新品 | しんぴん | Brand New | New Item\n New Product | A new product is something that's brand new or a new item. I like looking around the store for the brand new stuff because it's interesting! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Notice though that ひん changes to ぴん. This is because you're buying some brand new pins?
1782 | 仏典 | ぶってん | Buddhist Scriptures | Buddhist Writing | Buddha transcribed all of the rules of Buddhism in the Buddhist Scriptures and Buddhist Writings. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Note that ぶつ gets shortened to ぶっ.
1783 | 天井 | てんじょう | Ceiling |  | The heaven well is the well that goes up into the heavens. This is above you, and it is a ceiling. Maybe the "well" part is referring to the chimney that goes up through the ceiling to the heavens when you look up in a super old house? \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn that reading for 井, so we've got a mnemonic to help you out with that. Just note that the on'yomi for 井 isn't actually じょう, but rather しょう, it just ends up getting rendaku'd here!\nFixing up ceilings is a tricky task, but you've got just the man for it: Joe (じょう). Your local farmhand that does it all, nothing is too tricky or out of reach for him, you're starting to think that this man can do just about anything. What a handy person to have around.
1784 | 字典 | じてん | Character Dictionary | Kanji Dictionary | Letter rules can be found in a character dictionary. In Japanese, one kanji "letter" or "character" can hold a lot of information, so you have dictionaries dedicated to kanji meanings. That's what this is.\nThis word is a little old-fashioned these days, so you might also see 漢字辞典 used for a character dictionary. (You'll learn 辞典 soon, if you haven't already!) \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1785 | 古典的 | こてんてき | Classical |  | When something is "old rules-like," it is not very modern. It is in the past. It is classical. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1786 | 全治 | ぜんち | Complete Recovery | Completely Healed\n Fully Recover | All cured! That means you've made a complete recovery! You're completely healed! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1787 | 関心 | かんしん | Concern | Interest | The things related to your heart are the things that concern and interest you the most. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1788 | 関係 | かんけい | Connection | Relation | A connection related to another connection obviously has some kind of connection, at least between all those meanings. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1789 | 保守的 | ほしゅてき | Conservative |  | Who are all like "I want to preserve and protect what I have, get out of my business, government!"? Conservative people, of course. \n The reading doesn't match up for this word's 守. The reading is しゅ, but you can remember that because the conservatives want to protect and preserve their hoes (ほ) and their chutes (しゅ) from the government. For some reason those get taxed a lot.
1790 | 取材 | しゅざい | Covering An Event | Data Collection\n Interview | Your job is to take materials from a bunch of different people because you're covering an event. This data collection needs to be thorough, so you try to take all the materials you can from as many people as you can find. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned the on'yomi of 取 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou're covering an event featuring all kinds of chutes (しゅ). They have the whole range, from laundry chutes and garbage chutes, to evacuation chutes and so much more. You'll be doing some data collection and interviews about all these chutes, and you can't wait!
1791 | 下品 | げひん | Crude | Vulgar\n Vulgarity | Things that are below normal products are the cheap knockoffs and bad quality items. These items are incredibly crude and vulgar in their manufacturing and design. So much vulgarity! \n You haven't seen this reading for 下 yet (sorry there's so many for this kanji!) so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThose items are so crude that you can't even tell what they're supposed to be. Honestly they all just look like statues of lumpy geckos (げ). That says it's a lamp but it looks more like a gecko looking at the sky. That chair? Definitely a bunch of geckos having a pool party. Are you sure you didn't get this stuff from a weird gecko artist?
1792 | 危ない | あぶない | Dangerous | Risky | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of dangerous? It's dangerous. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Someone is in danger! It's poor old abe (あぶ) Lincoln. You try to save him, yelling out 危ないよ！！！！, but he gets shot in the back of the head anyways.
1793 | 曜日 | ようび | Day Of The Week | Weekday | The weekday day is the day of the week, as in "Monday" or "Tuesday." You'll be learning those on level 18, but first you should learn 曜日 to get you prepared. \n This word uses the on'yomi reading for 曜 and the kun'yomi reading for 日. You've learned both of these already, but be careful because ひ of 日 changes to び here.
1794 | 悪化 | あっか | Deterioration | Getting Worse | A bad change is exactly what it sounds like: deterioration, aka getting worse . \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. The on'yomi readings of the kanji are あく and か, but here they become あっか, to make the word easier to pronounce. Try and say it out loud to see if you agree.
1795 | 〜弁 | べん | Dialect |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. The 〜 is there to show this attaches onto things, like 東京弁, meaning "Tokyo Dialect." \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Because it's normally attached to other words it uses the on'yomi reading like a jukugo word normally would.
1796 | 辞書 | じしょ | Dictionary |  | Take all the words you use in writing, put them together and you have a dictionary! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1797 | 辞典 | じてん | Dictionary | Lexicon | You need to know the word rules of the language you're learning, don't you? Then you need a good dictionary that can explain its lexicon! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1798 | 事典 | じてん | Encyclopedia | Dictionary | If you come across a matter in which the rules aren’t clear, you’ll need to have a look in an encyclopedia! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1799 | 証 | あかし | Evidence | Proof | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: \nYour relentless search for evidence has finally uncovered the existence of a car sheep (あかし)! It's a bizarre hybrid, having a car's body but a sheep's head and legs. "Ah, car sheep! I've finally found the evidence proving you're real!"
1800 | 遠足 | えんそく | Excursion | Outing\n Trip | Far feet are feet that have gone on long excursions. These feet have been on some trips, man. They've seen some things. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1801 | 生存 | せいぞん | Existence | Life\n Survival | Existing life is in existence on this planet... What would that say about life and survival in such an unforgiving place? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1802 | 急行 | きゅうこう | Express |  | Things that hurry and go faster than the other things are express. This is often used with trains or subways, so look out for it if you're looking to get somewhere in a hurry. Also be careful in case it doesn't stop at your stop, because 急行 trains don't stop at every station (which is what makes them express!). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1803 | 外面 | がいめん | External Appearance | Outward Appearance\n Surface | The outside face to something is the external appearance of that thing.\nWhile 外面 can refer to the outer surface of an object, it’s more commonly used to describe someone's outward appearance, behavior, or demeanor on the surface. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji, so this is がいめん. But note that this can also use the kun’yomi readings, which makes it そとづら.\nWhile がいめん is neutral, そとづら is a bit negative, often implying that the person's outward appearance might be deceptive, hiding their true nature.
1804 | 顔面 | がんめん | Face Of A Person | Person's Face\n Face | The face of a face is a face, but more specifically the face of a person. Probably because the most face-like thing you can ever have is a human's face... at least in our eyes (by "our" I mean the human race's eyes, because I am totally with you guys on that one). \n The reading for 顔 isn't the one you learned with the kanji. But, we're going to learn that reading right now.\nThe worst thing that can happen to a face is if a face disappears. If it becomes totally gone (がん). A man that is walking up to you with no face, is a man with a gone face. Those men are men who are a part of the gone men (がんめん). Faces, totally gone!
1805 | 不合格 | ふごうかく | Fail A Test | Failure\n Rejection | You know that 合格する is "to pass a test," so what's the opposite of that? Fail a test or failure. \n If you know the reading for 合格, all you have to do is add 不 to it! You've learned all these readings, yay!
1806 | 遠い | とおい | Far | Far Away | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of far? It's also far (or it's far away). \n You want to go far, far away when you see a toe... oh (とお)! You realize there is a zombie toe on the ground and it reminds you of where you can go that's far from here—where the zombie that once had this toe went! (Remember the kanji mnemonic? It's that scooter zombie's toe that makes you say oh and want to go.)
1807 | お世辞 | おせじ | Flattery | Compliment | When you quit your current generation to join an older one, you'll need to use all kinds of flattery. Older people love being flattered; so be nice and give them some compliments. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Just watch out, as the 世 gets shortened from せい to せ! You can memorize this by remembering to be short and sweet with your flattery, don't make it too long and overcomplicated!
1808 | ふわふわ | ふわふわ | Fluffy | Floating Lightly\n Light-Headed | Who are who are (ふわふわ) fluffy? I’m thinking puppies, but ask yourself, "who are the fluffiest creatures I know?"\nThis is an オノマトペ meaning fluffy, like a puppy, a cloud, or a cotton ball. It can also describe the movement of a dandelion puffball or a jellyfish, floating lightly in the air or the water. And if you’re feeling lightheaded, that’s called ふわふわ too. Basically, anything with light or fluffy vibe!
1809 | 折り目 | おりめ | Fold | Crease | A fold you can see with your eye is a fold or crease in something. \n The readings are both kun'yomi vocab readings. You should have seen 折る by now which should help you to read 折り. Then there's 目, which I'm guessing you won't have a problem with.
1810 | 前面 | ぜんめん | Front | Front Side\n Fore\n Forefront | The front face of something is the front or the front side of it (kind of like how 外面 is the exterior because it's the outside face). This also means fore or forefront, especially when used metaphorically. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1811 | 基本的 | きほんてき | Fundamental | Basic\n Standard | The things that are basics (基本) like (的) are basic and fundamental. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Knowing how to read the word 基本 will be helpful too.
1812 | ゴミ箱 | ごみばこ | Garbage Can | Garbage Bin\n Trash Can\n Trash Bin\n Waste Can\n Waste Bin\n Rubbish Bin\n Bin | ゴミ means "garbage." Add a box to it and you have a garbage box aka a garbage can or garbage bin. \n The reading is just the kun'yomi reading, the one you learned with the kanji. Be sure to pay attention to the rendaku though. はこ changes to ばこ.
1813 | 門 | もん | Gate |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
1814 | 幸運 | こううん | Good Luck | Fortune | When you carry happiness with you, you look at the good side of everything and end up having really good luck. Someone who carries happiness will be really lucky in life. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1815 | 政府 | せいふ | Government |  | Politics and government. They are needed to keep the government rolling. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1816 | 卒業式 | そつぎょうしき | Graduation Ceremony | Graduation | You know that 卒業 is graduation so what about when you add ceremony to it? That makes it a graduation ceremony. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help if you know how to read 卒業 already as a word, too.
1817 | 食料品 | しょくりょうひん | Groceries | Foodstuff | Products you're paying a fee to eat later are your groceries. Buy them now, eat them later, yum! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1818 | 地面 | じめん | Ground | Earth's Surface | The ground/earth face is the surface that makes up the ground or the Earth's surface. \n The reading for 面 is what you'd expect. 地 on the other hand is じ, which is a bit different (though close sounding) to what you learned previously. Thank the Chinese and their ever changing language for this one. Think of Jesus laying on the ground, telling you how comfortable the ground is. You say "Jesus, you have to get off the ground, you have a dinner to go to," but he doesn't want to leave.
1819 | 保証 | ほしょう | Guarantee | Assurance\n Warranty | Giving evidence (or a guarantee) that you will preserve something, is giving a guarantee, assurance, or warranty.\nThis word is used when the emphasis is on taking responsibility for something, as in a guarantor, a product warranty, or quality assurance. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1820 | 阪神 | はんしん | Hanshin |  | The slopes of the gods! What could this be? Well, it's mainly just a company, known as Hanshin. They're based in the area between Osaka and Kobe. Think of it this way: 大阪 + 神戸 = 阪神! They're everywhere, though, and even have a baseball team (the Hanshin Tigers), so it's good to know. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1821 | 幸福 | こうふく | Happiness |  | With a little happiness and luck you can achieve happiness, though that goes without saying.\n幸福 is often used to discuss happiness in a broader, more abstract sense, like the happiness of a population or the concept of happiness in philosophical contexts. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1822 | 幸せ | しあわせ | Happiness |  | This is the noun version of the kanji 幸. The kanji means happiness and the vocab word means happiness.\nCompared to 幸福, 幸せ is more commonly used in everyday language and refers to a more immediate, personal sense of happiness or contentment. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nOn your quest for true happiness, you meet a happiness guru. She always says (しあわせ), "just be happy!" She always says that, and you always listen. You can't believe how simple yet profound her approach is!
1823 | 不完全 | ふかんぜん | Incomplete | Imperfect | You know that 完全 means "complete" or "perfect." So, a not "complete" or "perfect" is something that is incomplete or imperfect. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It also will help if you can read 完全.
1824 | 不治 | ふじ | Incurability | Incurable | When you can not cure something, this is a problem of incurability. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1825 | 保険 | ほけん | Insurance |  | When you are able to guarantee against risk, it's probably because you bought some good insurance! What do you use? The gecko 保険? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1826 | 面白い | おもしろい | Interesting | Amusing\n Funny | The face of this object is so white! Why is it so white compared to everything else? This is so interesting... \n The reading is unlike what you've learned before, at least with the 面 part (白い is just like the vocab word 白い). When you look at the white face of the object you say to your friend Moe: "Oh mo!" (おも) because you want him to come over and look at this. Try to imagine someone you know named Moe, or at least a celebrity or something named Moe.
1827 | 冗談 | じょうだん | Joke |  | When you have a superfluous talk you aren't being serious, you're telling a joke. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1828 | 関西 | かんさい | Kansai |  | The Kansai region of Japan is the Southern Central part of Japan. It actually connects the East side of Japan (at least back in the day) to the West side, making it the "connection to the west." For our purposes, though, we should call it "Kansai." \n Urgh, what a confusing reading! The 西 is さい instead of せい. Readings like this just make you want to sigh (さい), no?
1829 | 図書館 | としょかん | Library |  | A public building where written things are all diagramed out in a way that lets you find said written things? That sounds like a library to me! \n The 書館 part should be readable by you, but it's the 図 that's troublesome with an alternate reading from the one you learned. Imagine yourself at the library. You check out every single book you can about the human toe (と). You have a giant stack of books on it, then you drop it... ironically on your toe. You decide to show Khan (your buddy) your smashed toe.
1830 | 特急 | とっきゅう | Limited Express Train | Limited Express | Something that's special and in a hurry must be special indeed. This refers to limited express trains in Japan. They go fast, they stop at fewer stops (because they're special!) and they hurry. Look out for these if you want to get somewhere in a jiffy. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just note that the とく goes to とっ.
1831 | 行列 | ぎょうれつ | Line | Queue\n Matrix | You know the two words that make up this word, 行 and 列, and they both have similar meanings: a line and a row. Put them together and you have a line or a queue.\nThis usually means a line of people waiting for their turn, for example to enter a restaurant. It can be also used for a line that marches, like a line in a parade. In a mathematics context, it can refer to a matrix, which makes sense because they're lines and rows of numbers and stuff. \n This word takes the readings of the two words that make it up, so you should be lining up to read it!
1832 | 荷物 | にもつ | Luggage | Baggage\n Load | A luggage thing is your luggage. It's also your baggage and load too. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You'll need to remember the 物 reading as もつ, though. Why? Because all your luggage just got thrown into various moats along the countryside. It's going to take you forever to collect your luggage from these moats and by then it'll be all soggy. Dangit...
1833 | 仮面 | かめん | Mask |  | A temporary face is something you put over your face to cover it. It's a mask. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1834 | 明治 | めいじ | Meiji Era | Meiji Emperor\n Meiji | It’s the era of Bright Rule! If this doesn't make sense, don't worry about it. Focus more on the reading, which is めいじ. Sound familiar? This is the famous Meiji Era or Meiji Emperor. If you don't know about it consider reading up, it's interesting history! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1835 | 商品 | しょうひん | Merchandise | Product\n Goods | Articles of merchandise are still merchandise. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1836 | 美術館 | びじゅつかん | Museum | Art Museum\n Art Gallery | You know 美術 is fine art. So what is a public building that contains said fine art? It's a museum. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1837 | 折り紙 | おりがみ | Origami | Art Of Paper Folding | You know that 折る is "to fold," so what about "to fold paper"? Ever heard of something that involves lots of folding of paper that is Japanese? Most likely you have. This is origami, aka the art of paper folding. \n The reading comes from 折る and the vocab word 紙. As long as you know those you should be able to read this. Also, you probably already know this reading because it's an English word, too.
1838 | 大阪 | おおさか | Osaka | Oosaka | The big heights. What a nice area to be, it's where everyone wants to live! This magical place is Osaka. Heard of it before? It's a city, and kind of the rival to Tokyo. \n The reading is pretty weird, but then again so are people from Osaka (just kidding, Osakazens!). The 大 reads like おお from おおきい. Then, 阪 uses the kun'yomi reading as well, which you didn't learn. That being said, doesn't this kanji look like 坂, which also means slope? Well, it shares a kun'yomi reading as well, so if you've seen 坂 you can apply that reading over to here, making おおさか. Then again, if you know this word means Osaka you probably can figure out how to write it too. Don't forget the double おお though!
1839 | 外来 | がいらい | Outpatient | Foreign\n Imported | From foreign lands, you have come to this hospital. That makes you an outpatient.\n外来 describes something or someone that comes from elsewhere. You’ll see it most often in hospitals, where it means outpatient, but it’s also used in formal contexts to talk about foreign species or imported words. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1840 | 支払い | しはらい | Payment |  | The pay that supports you is made in payments. Whether you make payments to keep your house or your car, or you get payments from your boss, they keep you going. \n This is a combination of the on'yomi reading of 支 and the kun'yomi reading of 払. You've learned them both, so you know this too!
1841 | 写真 | しゃしん | Photo | Photograph\n Picture | A copy of reality is a lot like magic. How do you make a copy of reality, though? You take a photo. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1842 | 真っ黒 | まっくろ | Pitch Black | Pure Black | The reality is that it's black. Like, so black that it's beyond fake black, it's reality black. This is so black it's pitch black. \n The reading for the 真 is the vocab kun'yomi reading. Think of what is pitch black. It's your poor Ma (ま). She is so dark that she sucks in light, like a black hole... wait, she is a black hole, it explains why your Ma is pitch black.
1843 | 企画 | きかく | Plan | Planning\n Project | Take your plan and add some images to it. This is your plan.\nWhile 計画 refers to plans in general, 企画 specifically refers to the planning of events, projects, or initiatives, as well as the actual projects being planned. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The reading for 画 is the secondary reading though (かく), so take note of that.

Gotta join 'em to fix them... but can you survive that long without being corrupted yourself? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1845 | 保存 | ほぞん | Preservation | Conservation\n Saving | We try to preserve anything we want to exist with preservation. Want a special sea creature or bird to exist? Up conservation efforts! And, if you want to save data (like on a computer), you can use this word for that kind of saving, as well. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1846 | 首相 | しゅしょう | Prime Minister |  | The neck minister? This meaning prime minister makes sense if you think about the neck being the most important part of the body, kind of like the head! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. It also uses a reading for 相 that you haven't learned yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThe first prime ministers of Japan were actually the shoguns (しょう)… kind of.
1847 | 証明 | しょうめい | Proof | Prove\n Verify | Is the evidence bright enough to convince me? Is this really proof enough to prove it? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

1850 | 危険 | きけん | Risky | Unsafe\n Dangerous\n Danger\n Peril\n Hazard | Something that is dangerous and risky is probably pretty risky, dangerous, and unsafe. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1851 | 場面 | ばめん | Scene | Setting\n Locale | Everything on a location's surface is really just a part of the scene before you. This is the kind of scene that would be set in a novel. It's the setting. \n The reading is a combination of kun'yomi and on'yomi readings. That being said, both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned already, so you should be able to read this.
1852 | 画面 | がめん | Screen | Monitor | The image surface is a screen. Just imagine your computer screen. There's an image on the surface, right? It just happens to move around all the time, like most images on screens these days. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1853 | 手軽 | てがる | Simple And Easy | Convenient\n Quick | Your hands are light because it was a simple and easy task, so you didn't get your hands full. This word describes something that's hassle-free and doesn't take much effort, time, or sometimes cost to do. \n Both kanji use kun'yomi readings in this word, which you've already learned. Just make sure you rendaku the 軽.
1854 | 笑顔 | えがお | Smile | Smiling Face | A laughing face is a  smiling face (or just a smile!). 笑顔s all around! \n The reading for this word won't make you smile, though. You were smiling, but then you heard about the reading of this kanji. It made you yell out "EH??" (え). Just watch out for the rendaku of かお to がお.
1855 | 専門 | せんもん | Specialty | Speciality\n Area Of Study\n Major | Your specialty gate is the thing you open to let out your specialty. Imagine the thing you're best at (your specialty). Now imagine opening a gate in your chest that lets it out, allowing you to be good at it. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

That foreign place is having you study abroad. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

You can remember this because Ryu (りゅう) from street fighter is doing a study abroad program to learn more karate.
1858 | 急 | きゅう | Sudden | Urgent\n Emergency\n Steep | This takes its meaning from the sudden part of the kanji, meaning it's sudden, urgent, or an emergency! \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
1859 | 急死 | きゅうし | Sudden Death |  | A sudden death makes for just that, a sudden death. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1860 | 急に | きゅうに | Suddenly | Immediately\n Abruptly | Something that happens in a sudden way happens suddenly, immediately, or abruptly. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. Suddenly you can read a new word!
1861 | 日光浴 | にっこうよく | Sunbathe |  | You know that 日光 is sunlight so when you add bathe you get "sunlight bathe" ... but that sounds dumb, so let's call this word sunbathe instead! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1862 | 荷札 | にふだ | Tag | Shipping Label\n Label | A luggage tag is a tag you put on luggage. It's also a label you can put on a package before you send it, like a shipping label. \n This word uses the kun'yomi reading for both kanji. You've learned both of these readings already, so you should be able to read this word too.
1863 | 技術 | ぎじゅつ | Technique | Craft\n Technology\n Skill | You've seen 技 as a vocab word meaning "technique," and the kanji 術 means technique. So this means technique! Your technique is also your craft, and what’s needed for technology. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1864 | 証言 | しょうげん | Testimony | Verbal Evidence | Evidence that you say is testimony. You could also say you're providing verbal evidence. Hopefully you won't have to give too much of this in your lifetime. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

1866 | 浴びる | あびる | To Bathe In | To Be Exposed To | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means bathe so the verb vocab version is to bathe in.\nThis verb is transitive, and the object is whatever you're "bathing in". It could be a bath or a shower, but it could also be the sun. So you can both シャワーを浴びる and 日の光を浴びる. More negatively, this can also mean to be exposed to something, such as criticism or radioactivity. \n You want to know the best way to bathe in something? With a bunch of aardvarks (あ) in the water. They use their sticky little tongues to clean all your cracks and crannies.
1867 | 関する | かんする | To Be Related To | To Be Concerned With\n To Pertain To | You know that 関 means related. So, when you add する to it you make it a verb. Now it means to be related to. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
1868 | 折れる | おれる | To Break | To Snap\n To Fracture | You already learned how 折る means "to fold something" or "to break something". This is the intransitive version of that, which just means it has no object. You just folded something too far, and now it's starting to break. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned 折る, so you should know this one too!
1869 | 閉める | しめる | To Close Something | To Shut Something | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means closed so the verb vocab version is to close something.\n閉める primarily means to shut something in a physical sense (often with a sliding or twisting motion), like when you close doors, windows, curtains, faucets, and so on. Additionally, it can also be used for closing shops, either for the day or permanently. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhen you want to close something, use a sheep (し). Sheep are famously good closers. Doors, windows, curtains, you name it. Sure, they'll bleat on and on about how they're not your personal closer, they have their own doors to close, and bah bah blah, but they secretly love having the chance to shut something for you.
1870 | 妥協する | だきょうする | To Compromise |  | You know that 妥協 means compromise. So, what happens when you make it a verb? It becomes to compromise. \n The reading is the same as the vocab word 妥協, so if you know that you should be good (also, just the reading of the kanji works too).
1871 | 卒業する | そつぎょうする | To Graduate |  | You know that 卒業 is "graduation." Make it a verb, and you have to graduate. \n The reading is just the same as the vocab word 卒業.
1872 | 急ぐ | いそぐ | To Hurry |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means hurry so the verb vocab version is to hurry. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Someone who is trying to hurry is someone who is not at ease (いそ).
1873 | 問い合わせる | といあわせる | To Inquire |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The first kanji is question. And you learned 合わせる is "to join together." What's "to join questions together"? It's to inquire. When you inquire, you ask all your questions together, right? \n You know how to read 合わせる already, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember the reading of 問:\nYou love to inquire with your toes (と). By that, you mean you love to type on your keyboard with your toes. There's no particular reason for this besides that you like the feel on your toes when you type up an inquiry.
1874 | 存じる | ぞんじる | To Know | To Be Aware Of\n To Believe | This is like a very formal and humble way of saying to know or to believe. Sure, the kanji means suppose, but think of it this way... When you say "I suppose" it's like a humble way of saying "I know" or "I believe." You're not being as direct about it this way, and in Japanese, that makes you more humble and polite. So, that's why 存じる means to know or to believe.\nNote this word is typically used in the polite ます form. When you’re humble, you may want to be as polite as possible, I suppose! \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. If you remember the kanji reading, you'll have no problem remembering this vocabulary reading as well!
1875 | 東京弁 | とうきょうべん | Tokyo Dialect |  | You know that 東京 is Tokyo, and you know that 弁 is dialect, so you have yourself Tokyo dialect. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know how to read 東京 already, which you should.
1876 | 笑う | わらう | To Laugh |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means laugh so the verb vocab version is to laugh. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. You can laugh freely, now!
1877 | 残す | のこす | To Leave Behind | To Leave Over | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means remainder, but you can't really "to remainder." What is something that's similar that would make sense? How about to leave behind. This is when you're actually doing the leaving behind too. For example, you eat some food and you leave behind your rice because you're a bad child. You can remember this because of す. Every time you leave some food behind your mom would sue you, because she was a terrible mom. Imagine this. \n The reading for this word can come from level 14 item 残る. Associate the two in your mind and you'll be able to read both.
1878 | 固める | かためる | To Make Something Hard | To Harden Something\n To Strengthen Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means hard so the verb vocab version? To make something hard. You need to differentiate this from 固まる, though, which means "to harden" (the hardening happens on its own). This word means "to make something hard," because you're doing the hardening. You can remember this because you want to make something hard. And to do that, you send special "mail" (める) to this thing you want to make hard, and this mail does that for you. \n Since the reading for 固 (かた) is different than the one you learned with the kanji, here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhy would you want to make something hard? Obviously because you want to put it in a catapult (かた). There's no point putting soft things in catapults, after all.
1879 | 生じる | しょうじる | To Occur | To Arise\n To Cause Something | Remember how 生まれる means "to be born"? This word is similar, but it's used for when non-living things are "born". So as an intransitive verb, this means to occur or to arise. When used transitively, it means to cause something. You'll probably encounter the intransitive use much more, though. \n You'd think this would use kun'yomi, but it actually doesn't! Like other verbs ending in じる, this takes the on'yomi reading of the kanji. 生 has two of those, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nIf you wanted anything to occur in medieval Japan, you needed to talk to the Shougun. You always needed the Shougun's help to cause something. Without the Shougun, nothing would ever happen!
1880 | 約束する | やくそくする | To Promise |  | 約束 is a “promise.” So when you add する to it you’re making it a verb, meaning to promise. Now promise you’ll remember! \n The reading is the same as 約束 with する added. Make sure you know 約束 and you'll know this word as well.
1881 | 守る | まもる | To Protect | To Defend\n To Obey | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means protect so the verb vocab version is to protect and also to defend. This can also mean to obey, in the sense of obeying the rules. \n You need to protect against breast cancer, so you get yourself a mammogram (まも).
1882 | 辞める | やめる | To Quit | To Resign As | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means quit so the verb vocab version is to quit. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: "Hey, you going to quit?" "Yah (や) man, I'm going to quit."
1883 | 帰す | かえす | To Send Someone Back | To Send Someone Home | The hiragana ends with an う sound, so you know this is a verb. The kanji itself means return, and this verb is transitive, meaning it takes a direct object. You send someone back. You send them home. And tell them to never come near you again. So this means to send someone back or to send someone home.\nIn fact, most verbs ending in す are transitive. To help you remember that, think of suing (す) someone to make sure they go home! \n The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Yay! But since this word has a pair verb, let's think of a way to remember the ending:\nWhat's the most surefire way to send someone home? Threaten to sue (す) them if they don't!
1884 | 重ねる | かさねる | To Stack | To Pile Up\n To Accumulate | You've got lots of heavy things, so the only logical thing is to stack them all up.\nBesides heavy physical things, you can also use this word when you're going to accumulate things like experience, practice, or years on your back. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nAll the things you've stacked up were in preparation for your new casa (かさ). With everything inside boxes and neatly piled up, you're finally ready to move into your new casa. Hooray!
1885 | 希望する | きぼうする | To Wish | To Request\n To Hope\n To Seek | You know that 希望 is a "wish." When you "do a wish," that means to wish, to request or to hope.\nThis is a formal way to say that you wish for something, so you might use it at work to request an opportunity to work abroad, or let them know politely that you're resigning. \n The reading comes from 希望. It's also the on'yomi jukugo reading as well, if that helps any.
1886 | 書く | かく | To Write |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means write so the verb version means to write. \n The reading you learned with the kanji is the on'yomi one, but this word is read with the kun'yomi, か. So just be sure to remember the kun'yomi reading to read this word in the car (か) ... or to write it, or whatever.
1887 | 真実 | しんじつ | Truth | Reality | The reality of the truth is nothing more than the truth and the reality. Doesn't get any more real than this. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1888 | 不幸 | ふこう | Unhappiness | Misfortune\n Misery\n Death | When you do not have happiness, you have unhappiness, misfortune and misery. This can also mean death, usually of a family member. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1889 | 待合室 | まちあいしつ | Waiting Room |  | A room where you join other people to wait. This is a waiting room. \n Remember how you learned 待合 already? Well throw the on'yomi for 室 on the end of that and you have your reading!
1890 | 証人 | しょうにん | Witness |  | An evidence person is a witness, because witnesses are people who provide evidence (you know, with their mouths or something). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1891 | 動物園 | どうぶつえん | Zoo | Zoological Gardens\n Menagerie | Remember how 動物 means animal? Well when you add park it becomes a zoo. It's a park for animals. Except the animals can't leave. Ever. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1892 | 欠席 | けっせき | Absence | Nonattendance | When a seat is lacking the person it's supposed to have in it, there is an absence. Where is Johnny? Another absence? Ugh. Johnny. C'mon. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Note that the けつ is shortened to けっ as つs often are when in a situation like this.
1893 | 是非 | ぜひ | Absolutely | By All Means\n Right And Wrong | Absolutely an injustice! We must absolutely punish the perpetrator, by all means. First, though, we should probably define right and wrong.\nThis word means "absolutely" when it's used as an adverb, and that's the use you'll hear most in conversation. However, as a noun it means "right and wrong", as in whether something is right or wrong, or good or bad. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1894 | 結局 | けっきょく | After All | Eventually\n In The End | If you tie the bureau up with your delays this may not get done this year after all.\nThis word carries the nuance that despite the various events or factors leading up to it, the final outcome just is what it is. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Note the けつ gets changed to けっ as つs in this situation often do.
1895 | 愛知県 | あいちけん | Aichi Prefecture |  | The Love Know Prefecture! I want to live here, because people must know love! Of course, we don't call it that in English. You'll have to know the reading of the kanji to know the reading of this prefecture, which is Aichi Prefecture (jump to the reading to figure this out). \n The reading here is all the on'yomi jukugo madness you can handle. If you learned the kanji, you should be able to read this. If you can read it, you can translate it to "English" even though only half of it is English.
1896 | 常に | つねに | Always | Constantly\n Continually | The particle に here is a clue that this word is an adverb. An adverb describes actions, so what's a normal action? It's one you're always, or constantly, doing. That's what makes it normal! \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn. In order to learn it, think of this:\nI always tune (つね) my violin, but today I didn't tune it. So, now I sound terrible. Imagine how terrible my untuned violin sounds, compared to how it always sounds.
1897 | 無名 | むめい | Anonymous | Unknown | Someone with "nothing" for their name is either trying to remain anonymous or is simply unknown. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1899 | 相変わらず | あいかわらず | As Usual | As Ever\n The Same\n As Before | A mutual change you make with other people will go so smoothly that it will seem like everything is working as usual. It will be like everything is the same as it was before because the change was mutual. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own.
1900 | 原子 | げんし | Atom |  | The original child of everything is the atom. It is the child from which everything else is created, for it was the original child. Atoms are the building blocks of all things! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1901 | 出席 | しゅっせき | Attendance |  | The people who exit their seats at the end of the show are the number of people who showed up, not counting empty seats. This is the true attendance. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just note the しゅつ gets changed to しゅっ, as many つs do in this situation.
1902 | 不味い | まずい | Bad Tasting | Unappetizing\n Unskillful | You've seen 美味しい by this point. This is the opposite of that. Instead of 美 you have 不 (not), so something that does not have flavor is something that doesn't taste good. i.e. something bad tasting. This can also refer to someone who's unskillful at something as well. \n The reading doesn't follow any of the rules you've run into. It's まずい. Think about how you're going through this really long maze (まず) and how you're promised a really tasty wonderful treat at the end for getting through it (you're a lab rat or something). When you get to the end, there's your treat! What joy! You eat it and... oh man... it is so bad tasting you can't even believe it. Be sure to imagine the terrible taste and the terrible disappointment after going through that difficult maze only to get this... this... terribly unappetizing cheese.
1903 | 紀元前 | きげんぜん | Before The Common Era | BCE\n Before Christ\n BC | Remember how 紀元後 is "Common Era", or "anno Domini"? Well, this is the opposite because it has before (前) instead of 後. It's Before the Common Era or Before Christ. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will also help if you know how to read 紀元後 already, because then you'll just have to remember the 前.
1904 | 両側 | りょうがわ | Both Sides |  | Both sides is both sides. Which side? Both sides. \n The first kanji takes the on'yomi reading and the second takes the kun'yomi reading. Luckily you know both of them already!
1905 | 底 | そこ | Bottom |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This vocab uses the same reading as the one you learned with the kanji. Well played!
1906 | 心底 | しんそこ | Bottom Of One's Heart | Bottom Of My Heart | The heart bottom is the bottom of one's heart. Do you want to learn kanji? Do you want to learn it from 心底? Okay, fine, you can move onto the reading then. \n This word uses the on'yomi reading for the first kanji and the kun'yomi reading for the second kanji. You've learned them both already, so you should be able to read this too!
1907 | 朝ご飯 | あさごはん | Breakfast |  | The morning meal is the meal you eat in the morning. That is breakfast. \n The readings are the ones you learned with the kanji. It's also like the vocab: 朝 is like the vocab version, あさ and ご飯 is like the word you learned, ごはん.
1908 | 食堂 | しょくどう | Cafeteria | Dining Hall\n Diner | An eating hall is a big room in which you eat. What big rooms do you eat in? How about a cafeteria, a dining hall, or a diner? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1909 | 原因 | げんいん | Cause | Origin\n Source | The original cause is how you got into this mess. Forget all the things it caused, the first cause is the origin and source of what's going on right now. You can pinpoint one thing that caused all of this! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1910 | 喜劇 | きげき | Comedy |  | Rejoice drama isn't so much drama as it is comedy, since it makes you rejoice. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
1911 | 常識 | じょうしき | Common Sense | Common Knowledge | Normal discerning is the discerning you do on a daily basis, without thinking. It is all the things that you do that are common sense. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1912 | 完結 | かんけつ | Conclusion | Completion\n Ending\n Consummation | The perfect way to tie up a research paper is with a conclusion. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

1914 | 泣き虫 | なきむし | Crybaby |  | You've seen that 泣く is to cry, so you can probably guess that 泣き is just "cry." You've also seen how 虫 is rarely a nice thing to call someone.

1916 | 一昨日 | おととい | Day Before Last | Day Before Yesterday | Remember how you learned that 昨日 means "yesterday?" Well one day previous to that day is the day before last. \n This reading is an exception. Let's use this mnemonic to remember it:\nThe day before last you bought an "O" toe toy (おととい). It's a kid's toy in the shape of the letter O that you put on your toe. You know it was the day before last because you wore it all yesterday, and now today your toe is sore. If only you could go back to the day before yesterday to tell yourself not to buy that O toe toy! Or at least not to wear it for the whole next day!
1917 | 詳しい | くわしい | Detailed | Expert | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of detailed?

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

1932 | 外来語 | がいらいご | Foreign Word | Borrowed Word\n Loanword | You know the word 外来 to mean "imported."

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
1938 | 鼻歌 | はなうた | Humming |  | Try singing a nose song. How does it sound? Like humming perhaps? \n The readings are both kun'yomi vocab readings, probably because a 鼻 is a body part, and body parts do that to jukugo words. You know 鼻's reading from the kanji (はな) and you know 歌's reading from the vocabulary word 歌 (うた). Combine them together and you have a very nice humming tune and reading, はなうた.

When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You look up to see a crazy illusion. You can't believe it's real. Master Roshi, from Dragonball, is standing in front of you (you thought he was a cartoon!). Then, he splits into a million versions of himself, creating a mob of Roshis (まぼろし). This mob goes on to train many people to fight.

What is it that's drawn you inside? "Oo, cheese!" (うち) Cheese has drawn you inside. You're so excited that you exclaim, "Oo, cheese!"
1946 | 干渉 | かんしょう | Interference | Intervention | When you're fording a stream, and you suddenly feel dry feelings around you, that doesn't make any sense for something wet.

1950 | 伝説 | でんせつ | Legend | Legendary Story | When people transmit a theory through the ages, it can turn into a legend, or legendary story. Kind of like how the "theory" of King Arthur's sword turned into the legend of Excalibur. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Your love isn't toward a person, it's toward this giant Koi (こい) fish you met the other day. The fish is just so... so... handsome! You get hearts popping above your head every time you think about this koi!

You keep asking your pharmacist, Yuri, if he'll give you some medicine. He says no. You get pissed off, and you cuss yuri (くすり) out. He gives you the medicine after you cuss him out.

1994 | 細い | ほそい | Thin | Slender | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of thin? It's also thin, though it can be slender as well. \n If your garden is too thin, just get out the hose (ほそ)! How about if your hair is thin? Point the hose at your head! Hoses can cure any thin issues you may have.
1995 | 鼻先 | はなさき | Tip Of The Nose | Tip Of Nose\n Nose Tip | You know the previous part of your nose? The part of your nose I just chopped off? Well, you were lucky, as that was only the tip of the nose. Time to cut off the rest, next! \n The readings are the kun'yomi vocab readings. With 鼻 you learned that with the kanji. With 先 you learned that with the vocab. So, you should have all the pieces to be able to read this. Remember, body parts tend to change words into kun'yomi readings for some reason, no exception here.
1996 | 変わる | かわる | To Be Changed | To Be Transformed\n To Be Altered | You've seen how 変える means "to change" something. This word means that something changed by itself, so it means to be changed or to be altered.\n変わる refers to the act of changing into something different, and involves alterations in nature, appearance, or state. For example, it can describe changes in weather or the season, someone undergoing a noticeable change in appearance or behavior, or one's feelings or thoughts evolving over time.\nSince 変わる means "becoming something different," you can also use 変わった and 変わっている to describe someone or something that's "different from what's normal." For example, you can say 変わった人 or 変わっている人 to mean "an odd person." \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already so you should be able to read it!
1997 | 敗れる | やぶれる | To Be Defeated | To Be Unsuccessful | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means defeat, so this means to be defeated, but also to be unsuccessful. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have been defeated. You lay there on the ground, and the fans around the stadium are disgusted with your performance. Some hipster walks up to you and says: "Yah, Boo" (やぶ) referring to how poorly you did. "No boo!", you reply back. "Yah boo", they say again.
1998 | 悲しむ | かなしむ | To Be Sad About | To Be Saddened By | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means sad and this verb is transitive, so it means to be sad about something. Boohoo. \n If you're going to be sad about something right now, it will be kana (かな). Don't use kana when you're trying to learn kanji! You'll be sad forever if you're stuck using kana your whole life, so don't let that habit start now, friend.
1999 | 治す | なおす | To Cure | To Heal\n To Ease | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means cure, and this verb means to cure, to heal or to ease something. This particular verb is when someone does the curing. The illness or injury doesn't just get better by itself. How can you remember that? Because when you try to heal someone and you mess up, they can try to sue (す) you. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nI need you to heal him, and I need you to heal him right now (なお). NOW NOW NOW!\nThis also shares the reading for 直す, a very similar word you learned previously, which means "to fix." I'm guessing that the Japanese word なおす was only one word ("to fix" and "to cure" are pretty similar, right?). Then, there were two Chinese words for it (as you can see with the kanji), so the one Japanese word got split into two very similar words.
2000 | 干す | ほす | To Dry Something | To Hang Dry Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means dry and the verb vocab version is to dry something. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Why do you need to dry something? Because someone used a hose (ほす) and got everything all wet. Ugh, you shouldn't leave that hose out anymore...
2001 | 果てる | はてる | To End | To Die | If you tear (てる) up a fruit, its life is going to end. In other words, the poor thing is going to die. Fruit can't go on when they've been beaten up so much. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThe fruit's life is about to end and you laugh, "Hahahaha (は)!" And then you start tearing at it more! What's wrong with you? Weirdo...
2002 | 察する | さっする | To Guess | To Sense\n To Presume\n To Infer | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means guess so the verb vocab version is to guess. Alternatively, you can learn this as to sense or to presume. \n The reading for this is actually the same as what you learned with the kanji, but the さつ is shortened to さっ. If you had to guess be sure to guess with the shorter つ.
2003 | 愛する | あいする | To Love |  | You know that 愛 means love. So, when you add する to it you make it a verb. Now it means to love. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
2004 | 喜ぶ | よろこぶ | To Rejoice | To Become Happy\n To Be Glad | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means rejoice so the verb vocab version is to rejoice. Though to become happy probably sounds a little more natural. \n You start to rejoice by saying, "Yo, rock on (よろこ)!" Now you know how to rejoice from now on. At church or temple? "Yo, rock on!" Perfect.
2005 | 悲劇 | ひげき | Tragedy |  | A sad drama always ends in tragedy. That's what makes it sad. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
2006 | 梅 | うめ | Ume | Japanese Plum | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. It's also the same as the meaning of the kanji / vocab, though you can think of this as  Japanese plum as well if you want.
2007 | 梅酒 | うめしゅ | Ume Wine | Plum Wine\n Plum Liquor\n Umeshu | Alcohol that comes from ume is ume wine. It can also be called plum wine or plum liquor. If you're of age give it a taste, it's quite nice! \n The reading is just the readings of the kanji that you learned. How about a toast to easy to read words!
2008 | 不詳 | ふしょう | Unknown | Unidentified | Something is not detailed at all. I don't know anything about it. No details whatsoever. It's a totally unknown entity. It's unidentified. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
2009 | 米兵 | べいへい | US Soldier | American Soldier | Remember how 米国 is "America." Well, more of that again. With 米 representing "America" you can combine that with 兵 (soldier) to have yourself a US soldier / American soldier. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2010 | 勝敗 | しょうはい | Victory Or Defeat | Win Or Lose\n Outcome | You have win and you have defeat. When you are talking about both in one word, you have victory or defeat. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2011 | 西側 | にしがわ | West Side | West | The West side of something is known as the West or the West side. Sorry, I have no story to go along with your West side. \n The readings are the kun'yomi vocab readings. You should know both of them, with 西 being にし and 側 being がわ (what you learned with the kanji).
2012 | 無し | なし | Without | With No | This is the noun version of the kanji nothing, so when you have nothing, you are without. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhen you are without you don't have anything to eat either, so you end up gnashing (なし) your teeth together instead.
2013 | 青春 | せいしゅん | Youth | Adolescence\n Springtime Of One's Life | The time of young spring for humans is really just their youth. Just like plants in spring, your adolescence is when you start growing to your full potential! You might even say it's the springtime of one's life.\nThis generally refers to the period when you’re an energetic teenager and young adult. It can have connotations of exhilarating experiences and bittersweet feelings, as well as nostalgic memories. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned the on'yomi for 春 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nDon't let your youth go to waste, because it will be over soon (しゅん)!
2014 | 予告 | よこく | Advance Notice | Prior Notice\n Trailer\n Preview | If you announce something beforehand you will have advance notice.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2015 | 広告 | こうこく | Advertisement | Ad\n Advert | When you announce something to a wide audience, you're just throwing your message out there for everyone to hear. This is just a big wide advertisement. \n Sorry, you only learned the kun'yomi reading with 広. So, think of it this way when you need to remember this word's meaning: You're advertising something. It's a big advertisement to advertise how terrible a person こういち is. Come up with some terrible things he's done so that you can imagine this crazy Koichi advertisement you made and ran on national TV.
2016 | 笑い | わらい | A Laugh | Laugh | You know that 笑う is "to laugh." This is the noun version, because the う in 笑う turns to い (so don't confuse this as an adjective). What is the noun version of "to laugh"? It's a laugh. \n The reading is the same as 笑う, so just make sure you know that so you can know this as well.
2017 | 弓道 | きゅうどう | Archery | Kyudo\n Kyuudou | The path of the bow. This is archery. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

You can also use it in a jokingly formal way in everyday conversation though, like ちょっと借用しただけだよ (I just borrowed it for a moment). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2020 | 叩頭 | こうとう | Bow |  | Tap your head against the floor to show your subservient respect by doing this deep bow. This is the most respectful bow you can possibly do. (Thank you China, for bringing this word into Japanese and thank you Japanese for bringing this into English.) \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 頭 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThey used to make you kowtow every single time you came to とうきょう. That's full on head to floor kowtowing in front of everyone who is already in とうきょう to prove that you appreciate being there. They might even make you do it these days too, if you're not being respectful enough while you're there.
2021 | 弓 | ゆみ | Bow |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nAll we need to shoot a bow is you 'n' me (ゆみ).

Relax. Have some tea (or coffee).\nThis word often refers to cafes with a retro feel to them, though they can be modern too. These places usually serve a variety of drinks and light meals. \n The readings are what you'd expect except for きつ getting shortened to きっ and 茶, which has this strange さ reading. To remember that it's さ instead of ちゃ, think of this tea house you're going in. You think it's nice and pleasant, and it is for a while... until someone starts working a saw (さ) outside, ruining the atmosphere. BEWWEEEEHHHEEEHHHHHE gatatatatatat BWEEEHEEE.

You learned this reading with the kanji, so you should be able to read it already!
2030 | 留守番 | るすばん | Caretaker | Housesitting\n Looking After One's House | You know how 留守 means "absence" or "away from home"?

It's also the same as what you learned with the kanji.
2037 | 文句 | もんく | Complaint |  | A paragraph in writing is what you send someone when you want to submit a complaint.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

2039 | 可愛い | かわいい | Cute |  | It's possible to love this thing. It's so gosh darn cute! Any really cute thing is possible to love. \n The reading for this word is screwed up, though if we're lucky, you already know the word for cute. It seems to have injected itself into American and English culture a decent amount, anyways. If you are one of the lucky ones, you'll know that this word is read as かわいい.

2044 | 等しい | ひとしい | Equal | The Same\n Equivalent\n Similar | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of equal? It's equal (and also similar or equivalent). That "similar" one is a bit weird, because "similar" is not equal, though I'd lean more towards equal. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What should be equal above all things? I think each person (ひと) should be equal!

2046 | 等号 | とうごう | Equal Sign | Equals Sign | How do you represent an equal number? With an equal sign.\nIt's worth pointing out that this is a pretty formal word that's used in advanced math.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2047 | 留学生 | りゅうがくせい | Exchange Student | International Student\n Foreign Student | Remember 留学, which means "study abroad"? Do you also remember 学生, which is "student"?

This usually refers to the first time you fall in love, but it can also refer to the person you fall in love with. \n Similarly to 初耳, 初 behaves more like a prefix here, which means that this uses kun'yomi readings. You already know these for both 初 and 恋, so you should be good to go!

Notice how they're all kind of flat shaped? \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
2053 | 禁止 | きんし | Forbidden | Prohibition\n Ban | Stop! That's prohibition (prohibited)! When something is prohibited and you're forced to stop, that thing is obviously forbidden. If you see this you should probably not do the thing it's telling you not to do. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

This is the most common way to say "friend," so learn it if you want to make any! \n The readings for both of these are readings you haven't learned yet, though maybe you already know this word since it's fairly common. Think of it this way. You have your friend Tom (とも) Cruise. You like him, and he likes you. You're close enough friends that you can touch (だち) each other too. Like, on the shoulder or on the hand or whatever, without it being awkward. So, you like to Tom touch (ともだち) when you can, because he has nice skin.
2057 | 銀座 | ぎんざ | Ginza |  | The silver seat isn't some crazy kingdom where the king sits upon a silver seat. It is a famous place in Tokyo. Perhaps if you read the reading it will become more apparent what the meaning is (since they're the same).

When someone announces news on a topic, they are giving you a report on the information.\n報告 is a report given by someone after they've done some investigation or research into the topic.

Strangely, your buddy Bill Murray is here too. For some reason, he loves the smoke, and he puts his head in it, breathing it in deeply until he goes into a coughing fit.

2125 | 書き直す | かきなおす | To Rewrite |  | If you take your writing and fix it, you are taking your writing and rewriting it. This word means to rewrite, because the fixing is really heavy, so regular revisions won't do. \n The readings come from 書く and 直す. Know those and you'll know how to read this word too!
2126 | 座る | すわる | To Sit |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means sit so the verb vocab version is to sit. \n The reading is unlike the kanji reading, so let's use a separate mnemonic to remember this. Just imagine yourself going to sit down. You sit down, and the ground collapses below you and you fall. When you land, you find yourself in a nasty, stinking sewer (すわ). It is so gross. Taste the sewage in your mouth. Smell it. Feel gross. You shouldn't have sat down on that spot, it was looking awfully dangerous, now that you think about it.
2127 | 叩く | たたく | To Strike | To Tap\n To Hit\n To Knock\n To Beat | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means tap or strike, and the verb version is to strike, to tap, to hit, to knock, or to beat.\nThis verb can be used for both things and people, and the English translation will change depending on what it is you're striking. You'll always have some kind of object, though, since this is a transitive verb. So you might tap someone on the shoulder, knock at a door, or beat a drum. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhen you're going to strike something over and over it makes a ta-ta (たた) sound. Imagine you're about to beat a steel drum, for example. Now listen... たた! There! Did you hear it?
2128 | 洗う | あらう | To Wash |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means wash so the verb vocab version is to wash. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to wash a rock (あら) you found. It looks shiny, but you can't tell until you wash it.
2129 | 書き入れる | かきいれる | To Write In | To Fill In | To insert what you write into something is to write in or to fill in. \n The readings come from 書く and 入れる. Combine those two words to get the reading of this word.
2130 | 訓練 | くんれん | Training | Practice | You've got your instruction and you have your practice. Time to start your training, or simply your practice. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2131 | 駅弁 | えきべん | Train Station Bento | Station Bento | Remember how 弁当 is "bento"? Well, the 弁 in this word comes from that, so pretend it means "bento." Then, when you have a train station to go along with the bento, you have a train station bento. As you might think, a train station bento is just a bento that's sold at a train station. Easy! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2132 | 伝達 | でんたつ | Transmission | Transmit\n Convey | When you transmit something and you attain it on the other end, you've done a transmission. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2133 | 火曜日 | かようび | Tuesday |  | This is a day of the week. You know this because it has 曜日 in it. But what day of the week is it? The fire day of the week is the day after the worst day of the week (monday). You set fire to everything because you're so pissed off about yesterday, which makes today Tuesday. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know the word 曜日 as well.
2134 | 警告 | けいこく | Warning | Advice\n Caution | When you announce something to warn somebody, you're warning them. Sometimes you're just trying to give them some helpful advice. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
2135 | 書き方 | かきかた | Way To Write | How To Write\n Way Of Writing | This is the way of writing (kind of like how 見方 is the way of seeing). So this means way to write or how to write. How's your 書き方 for kanji? Mine is terrible. \n This uses the kun'yomi readings from the vocab words 書く and 方. So as long as you're okay with those, you can apply that knowledge over here.
2136 | 水曜日 | すいようび | Wednesday |  | This is a day of the week. You know this because it has 曜日 in it. But what day of the week is it? The water day of the week is where the water flows from. Think of your entire week as a big hill, with Wednesday (hump day) being in the middle. This hump is a hill. What originates from hills? Water! That's why Water day is Wednesday. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know the word 曜日 as well.
2137 | 忘年会 | ぼうねんかい | Year End Party | End Of Year Party | Time to get together and forget the year... what a terrible year, good thing a new one is coming. This get together is a year end party. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2138 | 座禅 | ざぜん | Zen Meditation | Zazen | When you sit and do zen you are probably doing zen meditation. Hummmmm. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2139 | 禅僧 | ぜんそう | Zen Priest |  | A Zen priest is a zen priest. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2140 | 禅寺 | ぜんでら | Zen Temple |  | A zen temple is just what it sounds like, a zen temple. Sounds nice. \n The reading is the two words 禅 and 寺 put together. The てら gets changed to でら, though.\nIn terms of when it's pronounced ぜんじ, if you put this word onto the end of the name of a 禅寺 the pronunciation changes to ぜんじ. It makes sense - it's more like a jukugo word that way (not that the original isn't, but you can see the separation of words coming together which gives the hint that it's a kun'yomi combo reading). Anyways, you may need a zen temple to keep your mind pure enough to remember this, but it's a good thing to keep in mind if you can.
2141 | 学歴 | がくれき | Academic History | Academic Background\n Academic Record | A continuation of studying is the time that passes that we study. This is academic history, so pay close attention! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2142 | 形容詞 | けいようし | Adjective |  | A part of speech that creates the shape and form of a word is something that is descriptive (its shape and form are in there, after all!). This shape and form part of speech is an adjective. You are so beautiful! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2143 | 五十音順 | ごじゅうおんじゅん | Aiueo Order | Syllabary Order | This is a little confusing for someone who didn't grow up with the Japanese language. You have fifty sounds. Then, they're in a certain order. So, these fifty sounds are the Japanese syllabary. That's hiragana / katakana, probably from back in the day when there were more sounds than there are now. So, the "fifty sounds in order" makes up aiueo order, where the "aiueo" is あいうえお representing the five columns. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2144 | 流石 | さすが | As Expected | Just Like\n Naturally | A stream containing stones is like… the most natural thing ever. It's just as expected.\nNote that you'll encounter this being written in kana as well, but the meaning is the same. \n Unfortunately, the reading for this is a total exception that you'll just have to memorize, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nJust as expected, I saw Suga (さすが) at the bar again last night… Mr. Suga spends a little too much time at the bar, and we're starting to get worried for him. 流石に Mr. Suga…
2145 | 猫舌 | ねこじた | Aversion To Hot Foods |  | A cat's tongue is for some reason associated with an aversion to hot foods. I guess I haven't seen a cat drinking up boiling milk, but whatever. Just imagine a cat licking up something super hot and freaking out. Cats don't like hot things, which is why this is an aversion to hot foods. \n The reading is the two vocab words separately put together, just as you'd expect from a body-part related kanji. So, 猫 plus 舌 = ねこじた. Just remember that 舌 is read here as じた, and not した.
2146 | 焼き芋 | やきいも | Baked Sweet Potato | Roasted Sweet Potato | Baked potato is actually baked sweet potato (or roasted sweet potato). Although it's literally just potato, most Japanese speakers will automatically think of sweet potato when they hear this word. Yum! 🍠 \n The reading is the readings from 焼く and 芋 put together.
2147 | 信徒 | しんと | Believer | Follower | A junior believer is a believer or follower. They certainly aren't the leader or anything because of their junior status, but at least they're there, and at least they're believing. Oh, and excuse me, may I take a moment of your time? I'd like to tell you about the glory that is the Crabigator.... \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2148 | 得 | とく | Benefit | Profit\n Advantage\n Gain | When you are able to acquire whatever you want, you start to see the benefits of everything around you and begin to profit from them. Aren't you so amazing? \n The reading for this is the same as with the kanji you learned. とく!
2149 | 毛布 | もうふ | Blanket | Wool Blanket | A fur cloth isn't something you'd just throw away. You'd probably turn this warm fur cloth into a nice blanket.\n毛布 usually refers specifically to a wool blanket, as opposed to comforters for example. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2150 | 〜冊 | さつ | Book Counter | Counter For Books | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as well. It's probably treated like on'yomi jukugo because it's attached to things (like numbers!).
2151 | 仏教徒 | ぶっきょうと | Buddhist |  | You know 仏教 means “Buddhism” so a follower of Buddhism is a Buddhist. \n Add the on’yomi reading for 徒 to the word you already know. Done!
2152 | 多忙 | たぼう | Busy |  | If you've had many busy days, then you're even more busy than you thought! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
2153 | 忙しい | いそがしい | Busy |  | This is a single kanji with しい on the end, meaning it's an adjective. What's the adjective form of busy? It's also busy. \n You're busy because you have to take care of your friend's ice ogres (いそが) this weekend. You don't know why you agreed to this, you were busy enough, but now you'll never get anything done running around taking care of these little ice ogres.
2154 | 年代順 | ねんだいじゅん | Chronological Order |  | You put years in order of the period they come in and you're really putting them in chronological order. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2155 | 布 | ぬの | Cloth | Fabric | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You take your cloth and put it on top of your head. It's there because right at noon (ぬの) the sun is in the middle of the sky and burns your scalp. So, you cover it with a cloth. Imagine yourself setting an alarm for noon to help you to focus on the noon part.
2156 | 混乱 | こんらん | Confusion | Disorder\n Chaos | There's a riot and everything's getting all mixed up!

2157 | 内容 | ないよう | Contents | Substance | Inside that form... there is something inside there. What are the contents? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2158 | 大きい順 | おおきいじゅん | Decreasing Order | Descending Order\n Largest First | When the order is from big (to small), you are talking about decreasing order. That's largest first. \n The reading is the word 大きい plus 順's reading you learned with the kanji.
2159 | 細かい | こまかい | Detailed | Fine\n Small\n Trivial | This is an adjective utilizing the second meaning of 細, detailed. So, this just means detailed or fine!\nYou can remember that this one is "detailed" or "fine" because the かい makes you think of coyotes. Your hobby is making extremely detailed and fine model railroads out of nothing but raw meat. This, however, means that coyotes regularly come in and destroy all of your fine handiwork. \n This word has a different reading from the ones you've learned so far, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nAfter the coyote wrecks your model railroad, he bites you on the head, sending you into an indefinite coma (こま).
2160 | 劇団 | げきだん | Drama Troupe | Theatrical Company | A drama group is a drama troupe or theatrical company. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
2161 | 飲酒 | いんしゅ | Drinking Alcohol | Drinking | Drink alcohol is drinking alcohol, or just drinking. This always refers to alcohol though. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading of 飲 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhere's a good place for drinking alcohol? An inn (いん), of course!
2162 | 容易 | ようい | Ease | Easily\n Easy\n Simple | The form in front of you is easy. Whatever it is, you'll be able to do it with ease. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2163 | 易しい | やさしい | Easy | Simple To Do | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of easy? It's also easy. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Everything is so easy for you to do. Why? Because you don't do anything yourself. You ask others. You say things like "Hey, can you get me some water?" They say "yassah!" (やさ) very enthusiastically.
2164 | 八冊 | はっさつ | Eight Books | Eight Volumes | When you have eight books you have eight books. This is an example of how to count books, so if you have eight of them this is what you'd say. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The はち part gets shortened as it often does when put into situations like this, making it はっ. The 冊 is all normal, and to the "book(s)." Har!
2165 | 非常口 | ひじょうぐち | Emergency Exit |  | You know how 非常 means emergency and how 口 can be some kind of doorway (like in 入り口, for example)? Well, if that's the case, then you have an emergency doorway. Usually you run away from emergencies, though, making this an emergency exit. \n The reading is the words 非常 and 口 combined together. The thing that makes this weird is that it's a mix of the kun and on'yomi readings. I guess things get all jostled up when you have yourself an emergency.
2166 | 入団 | にゅうだん | Enrollment | Joining\n Enlistment | If you enter a group, it's called enrollment or enlistment. You're joining the group. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

2168 | 笛 | ふえ | Flute | Whistle | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Pretend you're trying to whistle, but you can't. All that comes out is air. You make a "Fuuuuuuueh" sound over and over, because you can't get the whole whistling thing down. Go ahead and pretend to do that (or do it for real).
2169 | 二枚舌 | にまいじた | Forked Tongue | Duplicity | You have two flat objects that make up your tongue. What kind of tongue is made up of two of anything? That's a tongue that's split, that's a forked tongue. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. That's the case for the first two kanji, but 舌 actually uses the kun'yomi. Not only that, it's read here as じた, and not した.
2170 | 布団 | ふとん | Futon | Bedding\n Sleeping Mat\n Duvet | Put some cloth in a group and you get a futon. It’s just the kind of nice, soft bedding or sleeping mat you’d like to curl up on.\nKeep in mind that this word is different from the English version. We’re not talking about sofa-beds for your dorm room here. In Japanese, your 布団 is the traditional bedding you lay out on the floor at night and put away in the daytime. 布団 can refer to the sleeping mat, the duvet that covers it, or both items as a set. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The reading for 団 is the secondary reading that went with the kanji, though, so watch out for that.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2173 | 助詞 | じょし | Grammar Particle | Particle\n Postposition | A part of speech that's just meant to help your grammar out are the little things.

2178 | 昆虫 | こんちゅう | Insect | Bug | An insect insect is... you guessed it! An insect. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi of the kanji. You learned this reading for 昆 when you learned the kanji, but you haven't learned the on'yomi for 虫 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nDid you know that insects are Chewbacca's (ちゅう) favorite thing? He's fascinated by all types of insects, and keeps them in boxes as pets. There are a good few of them crawling around in his fur, too.
2179 | 自動詞 | じどうし | Intransitive Verb |  | Remember how 動詞 means "verb"? When the verb's action happens by itself or to the subject itself, it's an intransitive verb.\nIn other words, it doesn't need a direct object to complete its action. These are verbs like  行く or  着く or  消える. They're doing something, but they're not doing it to anyone or anything. Can you think of other  自動詞 in Japanese? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2180 | いい加減 | いいかげん | Irresponsible | Pointless\n Unfounded\n Careless | You add and you subtract. This brings you back to zero. There was absolutely no point in doing those actions.

That's the only qualification they're after, cucumbers and jeans.
2182 | 喜び | よろこび | Joy | Delight\n Glee\n Rapture | This is the noun version of the kanji rejoice, so it means joy and delight. You rejoice because there are lots of reasons for your glee. \n You already learned this reading when you learned 喜ぶ so you should be able to read this one too!
2183 | 昆布 | こんぶ | Konbu | Kombu\n Konbu Seaweed\n Kombu Seaweed | Insect cloth is actually konbu. Konbu seaweed is very common in Japan, and it's delicious. And insects happen to love using it as cloth, too. They make all their clothes out of konbu. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The 布 part gets changed to ぶ, probably because if a food doesn't have konbu you say boo (ぶ).

2200 | 梅干し | うめぼし | Pickled Plums | Pickled Ume\n Umeboshi | You know 梅 is a Japanese plum, and 干す means "to dry something." So when you combine them as 梅干し, you get dried plums, right? Well, sort of. You have to pickle them before you dry them, so we can say 梅干し means pickled plum or pickled ume. And if you know the Japanese name, you can call it by that too: umeboshi. \n The reading for this one, like the meaning, is kind of tricky. It uses two kun'yomi readings that you've learned before. So you have うめ plus ほし, which comes from 干す but gets rendaku'd to ぼし here. In other words, うめぼし. I guess the pickling process has mangled the reading of this word.

Note that this use is still intransitive because it focuses on the state of things being entwined, and に marks the location of the action, not a direct object.\nTo remember that this is intransitive, imagine suddenly hearing a lot of mooing (む) and turning around to find that your cows have somehow gotten entangled. They're all just suddenly in a knot. HOW?? \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.

2268 | 借り手 | かりて | Borrower | Tenant | Remember how 手 can mean "doer" in some words? So here, you have borrow doer, or more simply borrower.\nThis word is often used to specifically refer to borrowers in contrast to lenders. \n You'll want to know the words 借りる and 手 to be able to read this one. Combine them to know the reading.
2269 | 弓矢 | ゆみや | Bow And Arrow |  | A bow and an arrow. Put them together and you have a bow and arrow. \n The reading is the vocab readings, 弓 and 矢, put together. This is probably because this word is like two separate words put together, thus the "and" in the middle of the English translation.
2270 | お尻 | おしり | Butt | Buttocks\n Bottom | The お is just there to be nice to your butt. This word simply means butt (or any other word for it, like buttocks or bottom). \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
2271 | 確かに | たしかに | Certainly | Surely | This is an adverb, but it has the same meaning (basically) as the kanji.

2274 | 穴子 | あなご | Conger Eel | Anago | A hole child isn't some kind of creepy hole child (not sure how else to describe it). It's a conger eel, a type of tasty eel eaten in Japan. It might be easier to learn the reading first, though, and use that, because the second meaning option is anago, the Japanese word for it (also used in English). \n The reading is the two kun'yomi vocab readings combined. So, 穴 and 子 to combine make あなご. Just watch out for rendaku, which changes the reading of 子 from こ to ご.
2275 | 喉飴 | のどあめ | Cough Drop | Throat Lozenge | Throat candy is the kind of candy that should make your throat feel better. That's right, it's a cough drop or a throat lozenge.

You've learned them both already, so you should be able to read this already!
2276 | 夢中 | むちゅう | Crazy About | Absorption\n Frantic | Even in the middle of your dream you're thinking about your body pillows.

2283 | 難しい | むずかしい | Difficult | Hard | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of difficult? It's also difficult. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: It's awfully difficult to load a cow into your Moo-zooka (むずか). Click. Boom!
2284 | 災い | わざわい | Disaster | Misfortune | This is the noun form of disaster, so it means disaster or misfortune. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThink about how, the last time disaster struck, it was a while (わざわ) before things got back to normal.\nBe careful of the い on the end, it can be tricky and make you think it's an adjective when it's a noun.

Feel the anger when you see their face, "Oh, you again. Bleh."
2286 | 皿洗い | さらあらい | Dishwashing | Doing Dishes\n Washing Dishes | You know the word 皿 (plate) and the word 洗う (to wash), right? You can probably guess dish washing is happening here, but this is a noun, so it's the idea of dishwashing, AKA doing dishes, or washing dishes. \n The readings are the individual vocab words (you can tell because there's a bit of hiragana stuck on there). It's the reading for 皿 and 洗う combined.
2287 | 嫌い | きらい | Dislike | Hate\n Dislikable\n Detestable | You know that 嫌 means dislike and this vocab word means the same thing: dislike or hate!\nThough this word is an adjective in Japanese, it usually makes sense to translate it as a verb in English, because of the difference in sentence structure. However, a more literal translation would be dislikable or detestable. \n Of all the things out there to dislike the thing I dislike the most is the killer (きら) of people. People should never kill people.
2288 | 嫌 | いや | Dislike | Eww\n Gross\n Reluctant | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. The vocab has the added meanings of eww, gross, and even reluctant. \n The reading for this word is pretty weird. It's different than the 嫌い word you will see in this level too. It is いや, so when you think of something you dislike, just think "iyah, I dislike it." Also, think about that eww feeling it gives you when you think of the thing you dislike most.
2289 | 立入禁止 | たちいりきんし | Do Not Enter | No Entry\n Off-Limits | Standing and entering are both 禁止 (prohibited). If you see this sign, it's essentially saying do not enter or no entry. \n The reading for 立入 is a bit strange, but it might help you to know that it can also be written 立ち入り. The 立ち is the same one you learned with 立ち飲み and the 入り is the reading you learned with 入り口. In our version of the word, the hiragana isn't visible (it's sort of pushed into the kanji), but the word is still pronounced the same way: たちいり.\nAnd 禁止 doesn't have any weirdness going on, so at least you have that!
2290 | 夢 | ゆめ | Dream |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You're having this crazy dream. The dream allows you to do anything you want. Every time you ask "hey, can I do this?" The answer is always "you may" (ゆめ). Think of some things you'd want to do if you could do anything. Ask permission and get this answer in your imagination.
2291 | 地震 | じしん | Earthquake |  | An earth earthquake is just another way to say earthquake. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

You've seen this happen a few times before, so just try to remember that this is the case here.
2292 | 震災 | しんさい | Earthquake Disaster |  | An earthquake disaster is just that, an earthquake disaster. These are no good. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

2294 | 電子機器 | でんしきき | Electronic Device | Electronic Equipment\n Electronics | You have an electronic (電子) container machine. This is just a machine that contains electricity and electric parts. So basically, an electronic device, or more generally, electronic equipment or electronics.\n電子機器 refers to complex electronic devices like computers, smartphones, medical devices, control systems, and more. So while it can be used to refer to a wide range of electronic devices, it's usually not used for things like simple household appliances like toasters or kettles. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2295 | 最後尾 | さいこうび | End Of A Line |  | You already know that  最後 means "end" so the tail end is the end of a line. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. It isn't the same as 最後 though, so watch out for that! It uses the other on'yomi reading you learned with the kanji!

2344 | 罪 | つみ | Sin | Crime | If you have guilt then you have committed a sin or crime. Come here and confess to Father Koichi. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: When you come to confess your sin to me, you start claiming it wasn't you. You say it was some other version of you! What? How could this be? Well, you say "there are two mes (つみ) out there!" One is doing the bad stuff, and the other is you, and you haven't done any sins!
2345 | 煙い | けむい | Smoky |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of smoke? It's smoky. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You sort of did learn this reading with the vocabulary word 煙, but this one is just different enough where we thought we should make a mnemonic for this one:\nAll this smokiness is from a terrible chemical (けむ) spill that happened nearby.

2353 | 産まれる | うまれる | To Be Born |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThis is an intransitive verb. That means that it just happens, and we're not talking about what makes it happen. So this verb means to be born. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\nYou know another word that means "to be born" (生まれる), and they both have the same reading!
2354 | 困る | こまる | To Be Distressed | To Be Troubled\n To Be Perplexed\n To Be Annoyed | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means distressed and troubled.

Not too many things are more distressing and troubling than that.
2355 | 無くなる | なくなる | To Be Gone | To Run Out\n To Be Lost\n To Disappear | Here we have nothing, followed by the verb なる. A verb that means "become nothing"?

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: "I have a surplus of kittens from that last batch we made, Reddit. AMA (ask me anything, あま)."
2357 | 改まる | あらたまる | To Be Renewed | To Be Formal\n To Be Altered\n To Be Revised | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means renew so the verb vocab version is to be renewed. Like most verbs ending in まる, this is an intransitive verb, meaning it happens all on its own. Nobody is doing the renewing, it's just happening (as renewing often does). \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You probably learned this reading with this verb's transitive other half 改める, but here's a mnemonic anyway just in case:\nTo be renewed you decide to go to a spa. You get in a bathtub and they pour in a lotta (あらた) leeches and eels to help you to be renewed. Feel the fear. There are a lot of them! Alternatively, you can imagine them pouring in a lotta Maru cats, because that's way fuzzier.
2358 | 築く | きずく | To Build Something | To Construct Something | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

So it's a bunch of keys in cages, basically. Hmm, how artsy of you... Hopefully people get it. Isn't it a bit avant-garde to construct something like a key zoo?
2359 | 閉じる | とじる | To Close Something | To Close | Another verb version of the kanji 閉! This is a special one that can be either transitive or intransitive, so 閉じる means to close something or to close.\n閉じる is for returning things that have expanded open back to their closed state. It's used for books, umbrellas, web browsers, and even eyes and mouths. There are some overlaps with 閉める (you can 閉じる or 閉める a gate, for example) but 閉める is mostly used for things like doors, windows, and curtains. \n The reading is different from 閉める or 閉まる. Instead, 閉じる is read とじる.\nWhy? Because to close something that's expanded or spread open, you always use your toe (と)! It's easy enough with books, but umbrellas are a real challenge… But you, you can do it! You have the toe-tal control and can close anything expanded to the way it was before.
2360 | 犯す | おかす | To Commit A Crime | To Make A Mistake | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

Like connect people, hold hands, connect a cable to a charger, etc.\nFiguratively, when you want to connect something over time, like a conversation, then you want to maintain something over time as well. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you already know from the kanji.
2362 | 防ぐ | ふせぐ | To Defend Against | To Protect Against\n To Prevent | You're doing a prevention. When you prevent something, what are you really doing? You're trying to defend against something from happening. That's why this verb is a little weird and means to defend or to protect against. It can also be to prevent, too, but just make sure you're thinking of it more like you're defending something with your prevention. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You want to defend against the enemy? You should probably put out that fuse (ふせ) attached to that giant bomb first then.
2363 | 飛ぶ | とぶ | To Fly | To Jump | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means fly, and the verb vocab version is also to fly. In addition to flying, the verb also means to jump.

It's like forty pounds and holds you down.
2364 | 焼ける | やける | To Get Baked | To Get Burnt\n To Get Grilled | Remember how 焼く is "to bake," "to burn something," or "to grill"? 焼ける is just the intransitive version. That means no direct object needed! So this verb means to get baked, to get burned, or to get grilled.\n焼ける is used when something is heated and transformed by the heat. Depending on the context, it can refer to anything from a muffin getting baked, fish being grilled, or pottery being fired. You can even use it when your skin gets a tan or a house burns down. Well, that last one is kinda sad. I hope it never happens.\nYou can distinguish 焼ける from 焼く because when cooking, you always care (ける) to ensure the food gets baked or grilled really well. You want to make sure it's properly 焼ける'd (heated through) to be safe! \n The reading is the same as 焼く, so just use that knowledge and apply it here to be able to read this too.
2365 | 混ざる | まざる | To Get Mixed | To Be Mixed\n To Be Blended With | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means mix so the verb vocab version is to get mixed or to be mixed. This is when something is just getting mixed and you're not directly doing the action of mixing anything. You can remember this because the Tzar (ざる) of Russia is very impressed that things mix on their own and you're not doing the mixing.\nThe connotation for this word is you can't distinguish the things you're mixing, like combining paints, which become one mixed color that isn't two separate colors anymore. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: If you're not doing the mixing, in order for things to get mixed you call your ma (ま) up and ask her to mix it. What a terrible lazy child you are.

Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means overthrow or collapse, and this verb is transitive, like most verbs ending in す, so you are doing those things to something else. So, this verb means things like to knock over, to knock down, and to bring down.\nThis word can be used to talk about physically knocking something over, as well as bringing something or someone down, like a government. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You use the power of the Tao (たお) to do all of your knocking down. Imagine yourself contemplating Tao philosophy, then using those pleasant thoughts to knock everything over around you. BLAM!
2367 | 被る | かぶる | To Put On | To Wear\n To Cover Oneself With | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. You learned this kanji as "incur," but it can also mean cover. So 被る means to put on, to wear, or to cover oneself with.\n被る is used when you wear things that cover your head or face, like hats, helmets, and masks, or when cover yourself with something, like pulling a blanket over yourself.\nFiguratively, 被る can mean taking on a burden or blame, like you're "covering" yourself with responsibility. It can also refer to overlapping events — think of it like one event "covering" another on a timeline. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThe hat you want to put on is way too heavy for you. It falls off your head and hits the ground with a loud KABOOM (かぶ). You try to wear the hat again and pull it down tight, but this time it pulls you to the ground with an even louder KABOOM!
2368 | 刺す | さす | To Stab | To Pierce\n To Sting | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means stab so the verb vocab version is to stab.\nThis is a transitive verb, meaning that you are the one doing the stabbing... should I be afraid of you? 😅 \n The reading you learned for this kanji is the kun'yomi one. Since this vocab word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Guess what? That means you already know it!\nBut in case you've already forgot the reading, here's a mnemonic to refresh your memory:\nIf you're going to stab someone, use a saw (さ). It may seem more difficult to stab them with a saw at first, but when you see the damage, plus how hard it is to get back out, you'll realize saws are the ideal stabbing tool.
2369 | 面倒 | めんどう | Trouble | Difficulty | When you're looking straight into the face of a collapse it means trouble and difficulty coming soon. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

2370 | 余計 | よけい | Unneeded | More Than Needed\n Too Much | The surplus is measured and it's all unneeded. Yeah, it's definitely more than needed.

Wherever it is you're going via, you can't go wrong if you stay in a yurt.

2473 | 祈る | いのる | To Pray For |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means pray and this verb is transitive, so it means to pray for. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: "You gotta pray for Christmas presents if you want Santa to bring you some!" "I know (いの), I know," you reply as you begin to pray for presents. You should say this out loud to remember it better.
2474 | 乱す | みだす | To Put In Disorder | To Throw Out Of Order\n To Disturb | You know how 乱れる is "to be in disorder"? Well, now you're the one causing this. So, by doing this you are going to put in disorder, to throw out of order, or to disturb whatever it is.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Careful because the 設 gets shortened to せっ.
2477 | 目覚める | めざめる | To Wake Up | To Awaken | If your eyes are awake then you're going to wake up. Your eyes are usually the first thing to awaken when you're waking up, you know?\nThis word can also mean to awaken but it's like when you to come to your senses, not literally waking up. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You haven't learned this reading for 覚 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nIf you start to wake up in the middle of the night, it's because of the wake up wizard (ざ). He sneaks into your house when you're sleeping and pokes you with his wand. Wizards like when you wake up. They're weird.
2478 | 務める | つとめる | To Work As | To Serve As\n To Be Employed As | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means task so what's the verb vocab version?

You want to serve as my assistant, right? Just get me those two toes then!
2479 | 他動詞 | たどうし | Transitive Verb |  | Remember how 動詞 means "verb"? When the verb is done to some other thing, it's a transitive verb.\nThat means it takes a direct object.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

2481 | 制服 | せいふく | Uniform |  | If you control people, you make them wear the same clothes. That's a uniform. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2482 | 無敵 | むてき | Unrivaled | Invincible | You have nothing when it comes to enemies. Why? It's not because you're super kind and everyone likes you. No, it's that you've defeated anyone who's tried.

2483 | 口笛 | くちぶえ | Whistling |  | A mouth flute... Normal flutes you blow air through to make a sound. How do you blow air through your mouth to make a sound? By whistling. \n The reading is the kun'yomi readings put together. Thank 口 for being a body part, which tends to cause this to happen. So, you have 口 (くち) and 笛 (ふえ) put together, though ふえ changes to ぶえ, maybe because you can't whistle properly? Buuuweeee. Buwwweee.
2484 | 副詞 | ふくし | Adverb |  | This is like your side part of speech, as in, you add it to the side of a verb because it's an adverb. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

Time to plan and scheme for your next vocab/kanji.
2488 | 建築 | けんちく | Architecture | Construction | When it comes to building and constructing, the thing that encompasses both of them is architecture.\n建築 refers to the design and construction of buildings.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2489 | 反応 | はんのう | A Reaction | Reaction\n A Response\n Response | Whoops, this one comes out weird. You have anti respond though the meaning of this word is a reaction. Maybe you're "anti respond" but you have no choice, you have to give a response despite that fact? \n The 反 reading is all good and merry, but the 応 reading gets a bit wonky, turning おう into のう. This is probably because it's just way easier to say はんのう and sounds basically the same too. So, はんおう goes to はんのう and everyone's happy. Do you have a response?
2490 | 援助 | えんじょ | Assistance | Aid | If you aid and help someone you are giving them assistance. How kind! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

2493 | 赤ん坊 | あかんぼう | Baby | Infant | Here's a weird one for you. You have a red monk. What is this? It's a baby. Think about it. Babies, when they come out, are all red. Also, they have a shaved head, just like a monk would. So, a "red monk" is really just a baby. I wonder who's getting the shorter end of the stick here, the monk or the baby? Probably the monk. \n The reading is the kun'yomi vocab reading of 赤 (you learned this with the kanji) and the reading you learned for 坊 as well.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

He’s such a massive guy, it must have been quite the ordeal...
2497 | 失態 | しったい | Blunder | Disgrace | The appearance of fault is a huge blunder on our family. At least do not have the appearance of fault. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

2508 | 大勢 | おおぜい | Crowd | A Large Number | A large force is a group of people.

This group of people force is also known as a crowd, or a large number of people. \n The reading for 大 is the おお reading (like 大きい). Nothing you can do about that but remember it.

2512 | 各々 | おのおの | Each | Every\n Respectively | You have each each which is each (or every, or "respectively"). Kind of goes along the lines of "each and every" in English. \n The reading is weird.

You'll have to make up some lore about this "Sugar Tom" but whatever you do be excited about him.

2520 | 勢い | いきおい | Force | Momentum | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, which means you might think this is an adjective, but it's actually a noun! What's the noun form of force? It's also something's force or momentum. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, it uses the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned that reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThe monster that has more force than any other is the icky oil (いきおい) monster. It's the spirit of the hot, icky oil from the deep friers at fast food chains, and nothing will stop that giant mass of icky oil from hurtling at its target.
2521 | 一応 | いちおう | For Now | To Some Extent\n More Or Less\n Just In Case | Okay, only one response for that, and that is that we have an agreement... for now.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2525 | 大嫌い | だいきらい | Hate | Really Hate\n Detestable | Remember how 嫌い is to dislike? When that dislike is big, you really dislike it.

2526 | 高血圧 | こうけつあつ | High Blood Pressure | Hypertension | Remember blood pressure (血圧)? Well, now the blood pressure is tall... so you have "tall blood pressure." Well that's dumb.

If this is the case, then you are definitely in the past. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. But 去 has two on'yomi readings and you haven't seen this one yet, so here's a mnemonic to help:\nIn the past, you were a 子 (こ). You're not really a 子 anymore, but in the past you definitely used to be a 子!
2546 | 罰 | ばつ | Penalty | Punishment | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji... and you thought I was about to punish you because it was a single kanji vocab word. Now get over here. Time for a dirty spanking for thinking such a thing.
2547 | 変態 | へんたい | Pervert | Abnormal\n Transformation\n Metamorphosis | Your appearance is strange. You're abnormal. Oh, and you're a pervert because you look so abnormal. Though you could just be a caterpillar going through your metamorphosis to become a butterfly. You just look really weird while the changing is going on. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

2552 | 価格 | かかく | Price | Value\n Cost | When you value status you really care about the price of things. And usually the higher the value, the higher the cost.\n価格 refers to something's market value, or to product pricing in a broader sense. It's sort of a formal word, so you might see it on fliers or in business and economic discussions about pricing strategies, for example. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
2553 | 物価 | ぶっか | Prices | Prices of Commodities\n Cost Of Living | Things with value have prices.\n物価 refers to the prices of goods and services in a place — the prices of commodities, a.k.a. the cost of living. It's used when discussing how expensive it is to live somewhere or when talking about inflation. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The ぶつ changes to ぶっ, though, so hopefully that doesn't change the price you're willing to pay for this vocab? Right? Please give me your money.
2554 | 私営 | しえい | Private | Privately Run\n Run Privately | Anything that's privately managed is private and privately run. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2564 | 袖 | そで | Sleeve |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You already learned the kun'yomi reading for this kanji, so you should be good to go!
2565 | お土産 | おみやげ | Souvenir | Present | Are you visiting a neat place? Grab some dirt and bring it back with you. Then pretend to give birth to it in front of your friends. That dirt is now a special souvenir! It's the best present you could ever give someone! \n These readings are exceptions, sorry! Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhen someone asks you who gave you a souvenir, just say "Miya gave (みやげ) it to me." Who's Miya? No idea. But neither do they. You never have to remember who gave you anything ever again! Miya gave you everything you own. She's probably a great person.
2566 | 待機 | たいき | Standby | On Call | A waiting machine is a machine on standby.  This word doesn’t always apply to machines though. It could be a person who’s on standby, in which case you might also say they’re on call. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
2567 | 主観 | しゅかん | Subjective View | Subjective Opinion\n Subjective | What is your main view? Your subjective view, of course! This can be your own subjective opinion, and also refers to the idea of the subjective in general (as opposed to the objective). It can be hard to step back and look at things without your own unique biases and perspectives. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2568 | 提出 | ていしゅつ | Submission | Filing\n Handing In\n Presentation | Go ahead and present then exit. This will be your presentation of the materials.\nPerhaps it's the submission of your resignation, or the filing of a complaint, which explains why you exit so quickly afterwards. You could also just be handing in your homework, though. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2569 | 副題 | ふくだい | Subtitle | Subheading | The side topic is the subtitle or subheading, for example of a book or an article. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2570 | 応援 | おうえん | Support | Root For\n Aid | You must respond with aid in order to show your support for someone who needs it.

2571 | 支援 | しえん | Support |  | To support and aid is to support. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2572 | 尻尾 | しっぽ | Tail |  | Your butt tail is just your tail, though I wonder why they had to specify that it was your butt tail. Where else do you have a tail, I wonder? \n The reading for this word is a bit of an exception. You kind of already know the reading for 尻 from the kun'yomi しり you learned already. Here it gets shortened to しっ. The reading for 尾 is totally different from what you learned, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThe animal with the best tail in the world is the polar (ぽ) bear. They're stubby and white and cute. Only polar bears have tails like that!
2573 | 領土 | りょうど | Territory |  | The soil that makes up your territory is your territory. Ain't nobody goin' set foot on my soil nuh'uh. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2574 | 有り難う | ありがとう | Thank You | Thanks | Some people have a difficult time saying thank you. But not you now that you know how!\nThis is often written in kana, so you don't need to use the kanji when writing. But you'll sometimes see the kanji used so it's important to be able to recognize them! Did you know this is an abbreviation of 有難うございます? You can also spell it like this: 有難う. \n You've heard people say ありがとう before right?!
2575 | 混む | こむ | To Be Crowded | To Be Packed | This one is a little strange. You have 混じる (to get mixed up in), 混ぜる (to mix), 混ざる (to get mixed), and now this: 混む, to be crowded. It makes sense that when everyone's all mixed up it's going to be crowded, but how to differentiate between this and the other 混 words? Just think of how cows muuuuu (む) get all bunched up and crowded, which is why this word is to be crowded. \n Hey, come (こむ) out of that crowd of cows. It's going to be crowded in there.
2576 | 刺さる | ささる | To Be Pierced | To Get Pricked\n To Be Stabbed | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThis is an intransitive verb, meaning that the piercing just happens, without emphasis on what makes it happen. That's why this verb means to be pierced, to get pricked, or to be stabbed. This is a tricky one because the English translations often end up being transitive, but in Japanese we always use this with the particle に, not を, so it's intransitive. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\nLucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as 刺す.
2577 | 非難する | ひなんする | To Criticize | To Blame | Know how 非難 is a criticism? Make it a verb and you have the word to criticize. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Of course, it will be really helpful to know the word 非難 to start.
2578 | 検査する | けんさする | To Examine | To Inspect\n To Check | You know that 検査 is inspection, so the verb version of that would be to inspect. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know 検査 already as well.
2579 | 存在する | そんざいする | To Exist |  | Know how 存在 is existence? Well, make it a verb and then you have to exist. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2580 | 倒れる | たおれる | To Get Knocked Over | To Get Knocked Down\n To Collapse | You've seen how 倒す is "to knock over." But this is when something gets knocked over by itself. You know that you're not doing anything here, because when you're not touching all these fine glass items, it's very rare (れる) that anything gets knocked over (because you're not touching anything, you clumsy dumsy). It's also when you or someone else collapses. You didn't push yourself over, you just kind of fell by yourself. \n The reading is the same like 倒す. If you knew 倒す you will know the reading of this one too.
2581 | 諦める | あきらめる | To Give Up | To Abandon | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means give up or abandon so the verb version is to give up or to abandon. \n You hopefully learned this reading with the kanji, but here's a reminder just in case:\nJust before you're ready to give up on something, you yell, "AKIRA (あきら)!". You don't know anyone named Akira, you just saw it in a movie once and it made sense, you know? So now when you've tried really hard on something, but you have to abandon it anyway, you shout AKIRA into the sky. I just did it while trying to write this mnemonic!
2582 | お手洗い | おてあらい | Toilet | Restroom\n Bathroom\n Lavatory | You know that 手洗い is "handwashing" (and also a not as polite way to mention a bathroom). When you add お you're suddenly making it polite. Why? Because you're talking about something a little more crass than handwashing. You're talking about the toilet or restroom or bathroom. Ewww. Poop goes there. \n The reading comes from 手洗い, so if you know that you'll know this too!
2583 | 示す | しめす | To Indicate | To Show Something\n To Demonstrate | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means indicate so the verb vocab version is to indicate or to show. This is used in contexts like "a study shows that learning Japanese is fun" and "I demonstrated my willingness to learn kanji". \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nStudies seem to indicate and to show that sheep men (しめ) are better than regular men in every way. The sheep/man combo is a powerful thing. Or so studies indicate.
2584 | 判断する | はんだんする | To Judge | To Conclude | 判断 is judgement. Make that into a verb and you have to judge, or to conclude. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know 判断 before learning this, but if you don't I won't judge you (the Crabigator will).
2585 | 飛ばす | とばす | To Let Something Fly | To Send Something Flying\n To Skip Over Something | Remember how 飛ぶ is to fly? Well this word is for when you make some thing fly. So, this word is to let something fly or to send something flying. It also means to skip over something, such as someone's turn or a question on a test. \n The reading is just like 飛ぶ, so if you know that reading you're close. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember the second part:\nYou can use your strength to let something fly, and that something is a bus (ばす). You're that buff!
2586 | 確かめる | たしかめる | To Make Sure Of | To Verify\n To Confirm | Like with 確か, which means certain, this is the verb version of that. So when you "do certain" you are going to make sure of something or you're going to verify something. \n This one is kun'yomi followed by okurigana. If you remember the reading you learned with 確かに, you should know this one!
2587 | 圧倒する | あっとうする | To Overwhelm |  | The pressure used easily collapses whatever it's pushing against. That's why this verb means to overwhelm. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Note that the あつ goes to あっ, as you'd probably expect.
2588 | 経つ | たつ | To Pass | To Elapse | You know how 経 means passage of time, right? Well, this is the verb form of that. What does time do when it passages? It passes. So, this verb means to pass or to elapse. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What do you say to time as it begins to pass you by? "Ta ta (た), Time!"
2589 | 過ぎる | すぎる | To Pass | To Be Over\n To Be Too Much | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means surpass, but this verb is intransitive, meaning we’re not focussing on who did the action, but on the action itself. So this means to pass, as in “the storm passed”, to be over as in “winter’s over”, or to be too much. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nIn order for the storm to pass you’re going to have to sue (す) it. Sadly storms won’t pass unless you take legal action these days.
2590 | 罰する | ばっする | To Punish | To Penalize | When you do a  penalty to someone you are trying to punish or to penalize them. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. Just remember that the つ becomes a small っ so I don't have to punish you.
2591 | 置く | おく | To Put Down | To Set Down\n To Place\n To Put | When you put something you don't just put it, you have to put down this item or even (to) set down the item. Basically, you have to put something down with this verb. It's a little different from the kanji meaning you learned but not that different. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Just imagine you're putting down Oreos (お). One after another. Each oreo that you try to put down say in your head "Hello Mr. Oreo, I'm going to put you down.. ooh yes, you like that don't you?" REPEAT.
2592 | 在留する | ざいりゅうする | To Reside | To Stay\n To Remain | If 在留 is residence, then the verb version of that would be to reside.\nLike 在留, this is also a more formal term. You might encounter it at the immigration office, but you probably won't hear it in everyday conversation. \n The reading comes from 在留 so you should be able to read this one already!
2593 | 応じる | おうじる | To Respond | To Comply | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means respond so the verb vocab version is to respond.\n応じる is a formal word that describes acting favorably in response to a call, request, or demand. For example, 注文に応じる goes beyond just taking orders; it means adapting appropriately and fulfilling them. \n The reading is actually the same as the one you learned with the kanji! Not too shabby.
2594 | 営む | いとなむ | To Run A Business | To Manage A Business | The kanji means manage, but when you manage something, what are you usually managing? How about a business? So this word means to run a business even though the kanji is manage. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have to run a business. Your business is to make people eat who don't want to eat. "HEY, YOU EAT NOW!" (いとな).
2595 | 震える | ふるえる | To Shake | To Shiver\n To Quake\n To Tremble\n To Quaver\n To Quiver | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means earthquake so the verb means to shiver and to shake, like you would if there was an earthquake happening right now. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou start to shake in an earthquake because you're really full (ふる) from eating lunch. Now your full belly is shaking and quaking with the ground! Ahh it's awful! You never want to be full again!
2596 | 寝る | ねる | To Sleep | To Go To Bed\n To Lie Down | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means lie down so the verb vocab version is to lie down, but what you're really doing is trying to sleep. \n The reading is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji. So, you can go ahead and lie down for a moment before moving on to the next item.
2597 | 吸う | すう | To Smoke | To Suck\n To Inhale | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means suck so the verb vocab version is to suck, but it's usually used to talk about what you do to cigarettes, so a better translation I think is to smoke. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You smoke too much, and that gives you cancer. You decide to sue (す) the cigarette makers.
2598 | 観る | みる | To View | To Watch\n To See | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means view so what is the verb vocab version? It's to view or to watch. \n The reading here is actually the same as 見る. This is easy to remember because the meanings are so similar too, not to mention it has a 見 right inside the kanji itself!
2599 | 伝統 | でんとう | Tradition |  | When you transmit something that unites the people, you are probably pulling on tradition. Tradition is what unites us all and transmits who we are to everyone else. What is your 伝統?\n伝統 means "tradition" in the sense of customs, practices, or rituals that are passed down within a culture or community. These traditions bring people together across generations and keep our shared culture alive. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2600 | 面倒臭い | めんどうくさい | Troublesome | A Bother\n Annoying | Something is a trouble (面倒) and it is smelly (臭い). So what is something that's smelly and a trouble? Well, something that's troublesome or a bother, I suppose. Basically you can ignore the smelly part. For some reason someone threw that back in, but smelly things are a bother, I suppose. \n The reading is the words 面倒 plus 臭い added together. Just make sure you know those words and you'll know this one too!
2601 | 脱衣 | だつい | Undressing |  | If you undress from clothes you are undressing. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

2606 | 値 | あたい | Value | Price | A value is a value, but only in the mathematical sense.\nDepending on the reading, this can also mean price. \n Imagine a numerical value written on a tie (あたい). Now imagine that it’s the price of a neigh (ね) from your favorite horse. It’s a pretty high price, but you’ll do anything to hear that horse neigh.\nGenerally, あたい refers to a numerical value in math, while ね is a formal word for “price.”

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

Unlike 先生, this word is specifically for people in the teaching profession and cannot be used as a name ender. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
2693 | 一割 | いちわり | Ten Percent |  | One division is ten percent. You'll just have to imagine this in terms of tens going by. Must be some old Japanese percentage system that carried over or something. Just remember that one wari is ten percent, two waris are twenty percent, and so on. \n The readings are the same as what you learned with the kanji. You know much more than ten percent of this word's reading already.
2694 | 現れる | あらわれる | To Appear | To Emerge | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means appear, so this word means to appear or to emerge. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: It looks like something is going to appear in front of you. You are so scared and surprised you can't even speak properly: "Are what??" (あらわ) you ask, trying to figure out what's appearing in front of you.
2695 | 加わる | くわわる | To Be Added To | To Join In | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji 加 means add, and this verb means to be added to or to join in.\nIt is an intransitive verb, like most verbs ending in わる. That means that it happens by itself, or at least the cause of the adding is not you. Something gets added to something else, perhaps by magic? \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\nLucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as 加える. To help you distinguish between the two, remember that most verbs ending in わる are intransitive.
2696 | 埋まる | うまる | To Be Buried | To Be Surrounded\n To Overflow\n To Be Filled | Remember how you learned that 埋める means "to bury?" Well this is something that is being buried, maybe even you! Either way, you're not the one doing the burying. It means to be buried.\n埋まる can also mean to be filled, like a pond being completely filled by dirt from a landslide or seats being filled at an event. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned the kanji, so you should be able to read it already!
2697 | 建てる | たてる | To Build | To Construct | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means build so the verb vocab version is to build. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Think about what happens when you build something. What are you doing? You're standing it up. How do you say "to stand" in Japanese? たてる. That's the reading of this word as well. If you think about it they're similar!
2698 | 呼ぶ | よぶ | To Call | To Call Out | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means call so the verb vocab version is to call or to call out.

2699 | 確認する | かくにんする | To Confirm | To Verify | 確認 is confirmation. When that's a verb, you have to confirm or to verify. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

2702 | 断つ | たつ | To Cut Off | To Quit Doing Something | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means cut off so the verb vocab version is to cut off.\nThis is often used metaphorically to describe cutting off things that tie us down mentally or societally. This includes ending bad habits, so it also means to quit doing something.\nDon't confuse this with 断る which means "to refuse." You know this is to cut off because of the つ, which hints that you have had two (つ) too many chocolates, and it's time to cut you off. \n URGH! The reading isn't even the same as 断る, how frustrating. to cut off is read as たつ. Instead of eating too many chocolates and getting cut off, maybe you're eating too many tater tots (たつ). Don't eat so many of those, it's unhealthy. You have to cut off tater tots from your diet so you don't get fat.
2703 | 割る | わる | To Divide | To Split Something\n To Break Something | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means divide so the verb vocab version is to divide or to split something.\nIt can also mean to break something, as in ワイングラスを割る (to break a wine glass). After all, you’re technically dividing the object into parts if you break it, right? \n The reading you learned with the kanji is the one you'll use here. It's the わ one, though, making it わる.
2704 | 選挙する | せんきょする | To Elect |  | Election is 選挙 so when you make that word into a verb, you have to elect. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

2705 | 脱走する | だっそうする | To Escape | To Flee | You escape and run the hell out of there. Basically, you're trying to escape or to flee. Pretty simple. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The だつ changes to だっ, though, so be careful of that.
2706 | 秀でる | ひいでる | To Excel | To Surpass | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means excel so the verb vocab version is to excel. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n"He-e (ひい) is going to excel," you stutter. "He-e is!"
2707 | 済ます | すます | To Finish Something | To Settle Something | Remember 済む and how it means "to come to an end." This is like that, but slightly different. This is to finish something or to settle something, because this is when you're doing the coming to an end action. You can remember this because you're coming in to finish the score uno mas (ます) time. This is the last time. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with 済む, so if you know that you'll be able to finish this vocab.
2708 | 収まる | おさまる | To Fit Inside | To Settle Down\n To Be Finished | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nIf you obtain something, you'll want it to fit inside your bag. Otherwise how can you take it home? When talking about problems or emotions, this verb can also mean to settle down and to be finishedlike a dispute settling down or someone’s anger calming down.\nLike most verbs with まる as okurigana, this is an intransitive verb. That means it happens by itself, with no emphasis on the person or thing that's making something fit inside, or settle down. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou don't fit inside your bed anymore. I guess you've grown? Better get out the trusty old saws (おさ) and chop off your footboard.
2709 | 混じる | まじる | To Get Mixed Up In | To Get Mixed\n To Be Mixed | This one is a little strange. You have 混む (To Be Crowded), 混ぜる (to mix), 混ざる (to get mixed), and now this: 混じる, To Get Mixed Up In. It makes sense because it has to do with mixing, but how to differentiate from the rest? Well, for this one just imagine Jesus (じ) getting mixed up in a pot of soup. He's getting mixed up in this giant pot of soup because someone thinks that if they eat him, they'll gain his powers. \n The reading is the same as (almost) all the other 混 verbs. All about mamamamama!
2710 | 降りる | おりる | To Get Off | To Step Down | The kanji is descend, but this verb vocab word is to get off, as in, to get off the train, or to get out of the car. If you think about trains back in the day, you had to descend down to the platform to get out of them, which is how this word became what it is. You know that this word is the "to get off" word because once you get off the train, you enter the real (りる) world, where hardships are real and not as comfy as the train.\nFiguratively, this word also means to step down, as in "to give up" or "to resign” from something. For example, you can say ニュース番組を降りる (to step down from a news program) or ゲームを降りる (to drop out of a game). \n The reading is unlike anything you've seen with this kanji. Just think about how you have to get off at O-station. None of the other letters are your stop. Just O-Station (お).
2711 | 増やす | ふやす | To Increase Something | To Increase | Remember how 増える is "to increase" (as in, something just increases, you aren't doing the increasing yourself). This one is that one, where you're doing the increasing. So, this word means to increase something. You know you're doing the increasing because you said "yes" (やす) to increasing something, and did it yourself. \n The reading is the same like 増える. If you know that vocab word you probably can read this one as well.
2712 | 裁く | さばく | To Judge |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means judge so the verb version is to judge. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhen you go to judge people, there are different types. The one you truly hate the most, however, is the sobber (さば). "The Sobber" is the worst kind. They just sob and sob and sob and it's really hard to move on to your next judging.
2713 | 心得る | こころえる | To Know | To Understand\n To Be Aware Of\n To Consent\n To Agree | Remember how you learned that 心得 means "knowledge"? Well the verb version of that is to know. (You know it deep in your heart.) \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You learned them when you learned the kanji, so you should be able to read this on your own.
2714 | 導く | みちびく | To Lead | To Guide | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means lead so the verb vocab version is to lead. \n The reading for this one is a bit difficult, but there's a hint in the kanji. See the 道 in there on the top? What's the reading for the vocab version of that kanji? It's みち. That's the first part. Now, who are you leading? Let's say you're leading a bee back to its nest, via the road. It's a 道 Bee (みちび)!
2715 | 演ずる | えんずる | To Perform | To Play | If 演 is performance then the verb version of this would be to perform. \n The reading looks weird, but it's actually just the reading you learned with the kanji.
2716 | 備える | そなえる | To Provide | To Furnish\n To Equip\n To Prepare For | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means provide so the verb vocab version is to provide. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have to provide your friends with their own sauna (そな) because they don't want to use your shower. This requires you to go out and buy a sauna for your house (very expensive) just so you can provide your needy friends with what they want (a sauna). Feel angry you have to provide this.
2717 | 挙げる | あげる | To Raise Something | To Cite Something\n To Hold Something | The kanji means raise, and this verb is when you do that to something. It's transitive. So this means to raise something. It actually has a pretty wide meaning, and can also mean "raise" in the sense of to cite something, like an example. It can even mean to hold something, like an event. \n The reading is the same as 挙がる, so if you know that reading you should know this one as well.
2718 | 解く | とく | To Solve | To Solve Something\n To Untie Something | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

2719 | 張る | はる | To Stretch Over Something | To Spread Out\n To Swell\n To Be Taut | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means stretch, and the verb version means to stretch over something, to spread out, or to be taut, not to be confused with the type of stretching you do after a workout.\nThis word is both transitive and intransitive. When it follows を, it emphasizes the physical act of extending something over an area, like stretching a canvas over a frame, unfurling a sail on a ship, or roping off a crime scene. When following が, it expresses the resulting state of having been stretched or spread, like a bloated stomach, a swollen muscle, or a spider web. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nImagine yourself trying to stretch your favorite toy figurine, seeing just how far you can stretch it. With every stretch, you start laughing uncontrollably, HA (は) HA HA HA HA HA. Seems a bit cruel. Are you okay?
2720 | 理解する | りかいする | To Understand | To Comprehend | 理解 is understanding, so the verb version would be...? How about to understand or to comprehend? Well, do you? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Of course, if you know 理解 already this one is easy to comprehend.
2721 | 幹 | みき | Tree Trunk |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\nWhen you cut the tree down to produce a tree trunk, out jumps Mickey Mouse. "WHY YOU CUT DOWN MY TREE BRO?" he yells. I'm Mickey Mouse and I don't stand for this.
2722 | 裁判 | さいばん | Trial |  | You're going to get judged times two. Judge and judge again. Once by the judge and another time by the jury. This is a whole trial here. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You hopefully learned this on'yomi for 判 with the word 評判, but here's a mnemonic to help you just in case:\nAfter your ban (ばん) on the WaniKani forums, you now face trial before none other than Judge Koichi. He's going to decide whether your ban will be lifted or not. Good luck, there's a lot at stake.
2723 | 節目 | ふしめ | Turning Point | Critical Juncture\n Milestone | What seasons should you keep an eye on? The seasons that are turning points in your life. Keep an eye on those seasons, because you don't want to miss the critical junctures and milestones. \n This word uses the kun'yomi of both kanji. You haven't learned that yet for 節, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\nThe real turning point in your life was when you got yourself a few sheep (ふし). Owning a few sheep was a true milestone for you. Now you have all the wool sweaters and cheese you could ever want!

Just think of that wonderful feeling you get when the sun breaks and things clear up and it's awesome. \n The reading is a bit weird, too. Luckily, you've learned both of them already. 晴れる is はれる. That's the reading you use here, though は goes to ば.

Remember this by thinking how much children love domo-kun.\nAlso, 子ども is kind of more "politically correct" with the kana hanging off there. 子供 is still used in a lot of situations, usually stiff ones.

2838 | 突く | つく | To Stab | To Poke\n To Jab | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means stab so the verb vocab version must also be to stab.\nWondering how it’s different from 刺す? 突く refers to the act of pushing or pressing something with a tip of an object, often done forcefully and swiftly. So when you use 突く as in “to stab,” your focus is on the forcefulness of the action. On the other hand, 刺す focuses more on the actual act of piercing into something or someone with a sharp thing.\nThis is why 突く can be be translated many ways, like to poke, to jab, and many more. \n If you're going to get stabbed, don't get stabbed two (つ) times.

2841 | 触る | さわる | To Touch Something | To Touch | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means touch so the verb vocab version is to touch something.\n触る is used when someone does the touching. It's not used to describe objects touching each other.\nNote that 触る can be used with either the particle に or を, like 手に触る or 手を触る (to touch a hand).

2881 | 区分 | くぶん | Division | Section\n Classification | Think about a part of the district. Separate them out in your mind (these parts). Each part is a division of the district.

It's a bit of an expensive habit, but I think you deserve it.
2891 | 新鮮 | しんせん | Fresh |  | New and fresh is fresh (has to be new if you want it to be fresh, after all).\nThis word is used to describe fresh vegetables, fish, air, and new ideas or experiences, but is not commonly used to describe freshly made food or drinks.

2892 | 鮮魚 | せんぎょ | Fresh Fish |  | Fresh fish is fresh fish (and the best fish, nom nom nom).\nThis is a fairly specialized word that you’d mostly see at a market.

You know both readings, but it's all a little strange, so here's a mnemonic help you:\nTo present yourself as an honest person, you should hurry up and change into a suit now (すなお). We all know that people in suits look more honest and upfront, so go get suited up now!
2897 | 光栄 | こうえい | Honor | Privilege | When a light shines on how much you've prospered, it's a great honor.

Hang the numbers instead!! \n This is the kun'yomi reading for 掛 and the on'yomi for 算. And the さん reading is rendaku'd into ざん.

2934 | 影 | かげ | Shadow |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Just imagine the shadow of a cage (かげ). Lots of long bars. Looks good.
2935 | 肩こり | かたこり | Shoulder Stiffness | Stiff Shoulders\n Stiff Neck | When your shoulders get a little こり, it means you've got shoulder stiffness or a stiff neck.\nThe こり here is a nominalized version of the verb こる, which means "to become stiff," so maybe that'll help you remember this! \n You already know the reading of 肩, and this is just that with some hiragana added on!

These two buildings just seemed to pop up out of nowhere and, unfortunately, they're now blocking your view. \n The reading is shared with 建てる, so if you know 建てる then you should be able to read this word as well.
2939 | 呼ばれる | よばれる | To Be Called |  | If 呼ぶ is "to call" then this is something similar. This is when you are called by someone (and you're not doing the calling). This word is to be called. \n The reading is shared with 呼ぶ, so remember that and you'll be able to read this too.
2940 | 捕まる | つかまる | To Be Caught | To Get Caught | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means catch so the intransitive verb vocab version is to be caught. This is a literal, physical catch. So, for example, you can catch a criminal using this verb but not catch the drift of an idea, which would be 捕える, coming up in level 27. \n The reading is つか, so to remember that with to be caught, think about how you're a police officer trying to catch some criminals. Unfortunately, they have split up into two cars (つか) meaning you won't catch both of them, since you only have one car.
2941 | 慣れる | なれる | To Become Accustomed To | To Get Used To | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means accustomed so the verb vocab version is to become accustomed. \n What have you become accustomed to? All the Narwhals (な) you hang out with. They take some getting used to.
2942 | 割れる | われる | To Be Divided | To Be Split\n To Break | Remember how 割る is "to divide"? Now you're learning the intransitive version. Instead of you doing the dividing, something just gets divided or split up. So this is to be divided or to be split.\nIt can also mean to break, as in ワイングラスが割れる (the wine glass breaks). After all, when an object breaks, it’s divided into parts, right? \n The reading is shared with 割る.
2943 | 効く | きく | To Be Effective | To Work Effectively | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means effective.

It's your key (き). It's effective at opening your house door.
2944 | 係わる | かかわる | To Be Involved | To Be Related\n To Be Connected | You know that the kanji means connection. This is a verb, so one meaning is to be connected. It can also mean to be involved and to be related. Basically things that have to do with being connected with something else.\nDoes this all sound familiar? In fact, this is another way to write 関わる, which you already learned! The two have exactly the same meaning, but this version is a bit less common. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. It's exactly the same as the reading for 関わる, so here's a reminder of that mnemonic to help you:\nRemember the "Kaw Kaw (かか) Crow Gang"? They are bad news, always eating from garbage and squawking "kaw kaw"... You don't want to be involved with them.
2945 | 構う | かまう | To Care About | To Mind | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means care so the verb vocab version is to care about.\nThis word generally implies a more direct physical or verbal expression of care, rather than just mentally caring about someone or something. The exception is when it's used in the negative, like 構わない (I don't mind). \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Do you care a lot about grammar? I don't care, unless it has to do with commas (かま). Then I do flip out.
2946 | 捉える | とらえる | To Catch | To Grasp\n To Perceive\n To Captivate | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means catch so the verb version is to catch.\nTry to remember the mnemonic from the kanji with this one, because this word isn't used for physically catching things, but for ideas or meanings that you are able to grasp, metaphorically speaking. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji, so you should be able to read it already!
2947 | 渡る | わたる | To Cross | To Cross Over\n To Go Across | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means transit, which is just another word for crossing through or crossing over. That's why this word is to cross or to cross over. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
2948 | 響く | ひびく | To Echo | To Reverberate\n To Resound | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

2949 | 居る | いる | To Exist | To Be | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means alive and the verb version means to exist or to be, for anything that is alive and moving, like people and animals.\nThe kanji isn't used too often for this word, so when you're writing just use the kana. But you'll see the kanji used sometimes so it's important to be able to recognize it! \n Do you know the word いる? This is the kanji version! If you've been studying Japanese up to this point you probably already know that word. You can associate these two things together into one and remember the reading at the same time!
2950 | 掛ける | かける | To Hang Something | To Hang Up Something | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means hang so the verb vocab version is to hang something or to hang up something (as in to hang it up by a hook).\nYou can remember this because you must care (ける) about the way you hang something up. Without care, it won't stay hanging for long. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji.
2951 | 隠す | かくす | To Hide Something | To Conceal Something | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means hide and the verb vocab version is to hide something or to conceal something. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.

Well, "F*** (ふく) you!" you yell at them, because they wouldn't include you.
2953 | 増す | ます | To Increase | To Grow | It's another verb with the kanji 増! This one means to increase too! But!\nJust like 増える, this is when something is just increasing on its own. You can use this word to talk about an increase in number, quantity, or degree, but it’s more literary and less common than 増える, except when referring to an increase in degree. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhat increases with time? Your love for your mama (ま)! Your love for her will grow and grow the older you get!

This word is usually used when you're looking at landscapes or a really large area. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own.
2956 | 今更 | いまさら | Too Late | Now | Now isn’t good enough for renewal. It’s already too late. The time has passed now. \n You might be tempted to read this with on’yomi, but this is actually 今 and 更に put together, just without the に particle at the end. Try to remember it in this way, or just make a mental note to use kun’yomi here!
2957 | 頑張る | がんばる | To Persevere | To Do One's Best | 張る is to stretch. You're stubborn and want to stretch out what you're doing right now. Although you're stubborn, you keep doing it.

Just go ahead and extract it out of your memory so you can use it here.
2960 | 問う | とう | To Question Something |  | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

The kanji itself means replace so the verb vocab version is to replace. You know that you're doing the replacing because of the air (える). You're replacing the air as quickly as you can because if you don't you wouldn't be able to breathe in this small room.\n替える means to replace something with another item of the same kind or equivalent, rather than changing its state. Wondering how it differs from 代える? While 代える stresses that you’re using someone or something “in place of another,” 替える simply indicates the act of swapping one thing for another similar thing. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
2962 | 巻く | まく | To Roll | To Wind\n To Wrap\n To Coil | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means scroll. But, you don't "to scroll." What do you do to scrolls, though? You roll them up, making this word "to roll."\nThis word can also mean to wind, like when winding thread or a watch, or to wrap when involving a rolling or coiling motion, like wrapping sushi in seaweed or wrapping a cozy scarf around your neck. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The thing you are rolling up is your ma (ま).

2964 | 現す | あらわす | To Show | To Reveal | This is the transitive version of 現れる (to appear), so rather than something appearing on its own, you’re making it appear. So this word means to show or to reveal, but it’s usually used in set phrases like 姿を現す (to show up) or 正体を現す (to reveal one's true nature). \n Do you remember learning 現れる? This has the same exact pronunciation!
2965 | 収める | おさめる | To Store | To Achieve\n To Score | When you obtain something you need to keep it safe, so you decide to store it somewhere. Then you can always go back and look at the thing you managed to achieve or  to score, and no one can take it from you.\n収める means "to store" with an emphasis on placing something in their proper location. This nuance extends to convey a sense of accomplishment, such as "achieving a favorable outcome.” \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with 収まる, but here's a mnemonic to remind you just in case:\nYou need to store all of the old saws (おさ). You were able to finish and to achieve everything you wanted with them, so it's time to put them away so they'll be safe.
2966 | 絞める | しめる | To Strangle |  | The kanji means strangle and this vocab is the verb version of that: to strangle. It’s usually used in the phrase 首を絞める, which also means “to strangle.”\nThere is another word, 絞る which means "to wring out" that looks very similar.

When you get this in the mail, you know it's about strangling. \n The thing that is threatening to strangle you is actually a sheep (し)! The sheep comes to your house and says, "here's the sheep mail!" and then tries to strangle you. It puts its hard feet on your neck though it's pretty ineffective.

2968 | 補う | おぎなう | To Supplement | To Compensate For | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means supplement so the verb vocab version is to supplement.\nNote that this word is generally considered relatively formal in tone. \n Oh, gee, now (おぎな) you're going to supplement it? That would have been helpful earlier. Might help to say "oh gee now" with a ぎ sound instead of "ji" sound out loud, too. This is a tricky reading, won't be learned too easily, so think about it a bit now.
2969 | 優れる | すぐれる | To Surpass | To Excel | This is the verb version of the kanji superior, so it means to surpass. Someone who is superior is always going to surpass and to excel beyond others. That's what makes them so superior in the first place!\nThis is a formal word that is often used in writing or formal speech. \n Remember how 今すぐ means "at once"? Well that's the key to surpassing others. You have to do everything 今すぐ!!!

Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. You already learned that 降りる means "to get off." This is when you're helping something else descend down from something, not when you yourself are getting down. So it means to take down or to lower. \n This word uses the kun'yomi reading, which you already learned. Go you!
2971 | 投票する | とうひょうする | To Vote |  | Throw a ballot in the ballot box to vote. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

2972 | 絞る | しぼる | To Wring Out | To Squeeze\n To Narrow Down | You've learned that the kanji 絞 means strangle. 絞る, on the other hand, means to wring out or to squeeze something like a towel, or to narrow down ideas. \n Your friend wants to wring out a towel, but before she does so she bows (しぼ) to the towel to show her respect for it.
2973 | 家庭教師 | かていきょうし | Tutor | Coach\n Private Teacher | This is a combination of the words 家庭 and 教師. A "teacher" who only teaches when you're with your "family" is known as a tutor. They don't teach you at school, they're a private teacher that comes to your home to help you learn. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
2974 | 鮮やか | あざやか | Vivid | Splendid\n Brilliant | Alright, so it's not quite the same, but something that is fresh is also vivid and splendid. I know those are a couple things I'd associate with freshness. Try to make the connection here before moving on. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: This vivid and splendid fresh fish is MINE! You grab the other (あざ) one that's not as vivid and splendid.

3054 | 激励 | げきれい | Strong Encouragement | Encouragement | If someone is fierce when they encourage you, that's some strong encouragement!\nThis word is kind of formal, and using it will really communicate your appreciation for the encouragement someone gives you.

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhen you think of people who are suspicious or shady, you naturally think of people named Aya. Just think of our artist Aya, she's super suspicious and shady!
3058 | 汗 | あせ | Sweat |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same one you learned with the kanji. Also, your sweat smells like ass (あせ).

The kanji itself means replace, and this word means to be replaced, to be substituted, and to be switched.\nWondering about the difference between 代わる and 替わる? 代わる is used when someone or something takes the place of another, like filling in for a sick coworker. Whereas 替わる is used when things or situations switch places or are replaced with something new, like when talking about generations changing or a new governmental cabinet taking over.\nThis verb is intransitive, meaning it doesn't take a direct object. You'll sometimes see it with the particle を, though, because the を is showing a "path" rather than a direct object in this case. For example, 席を替わる (to switch seats) indicates your location is moving from one seat to another. Likewise, 電話を替わる indicates that a call is being handed off to another person. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
3063 | 燃える | もえる | To Burn | To Be On Fire | Remember how 燃やす means "to burn something" or "to set on fire”? Well, 燃える is the version that means to burn or to be on fire. You might say that paper and wood 燃える easily, for example. And if your house is 燃えている, you're in trouble.\nYou can remember this slightly different meaning for 燃える because of the える part, which refers to the letter "L."

So it means to construct or to build or to make, and it's usually used with ships, bridges, buildings, and other large-scale work.\nIt can also mean to brew, as in brewing sake. I guess brewing is like constructing, since it involves carefully choosing and mixing ingredients to get those sip-worthy creations! \n The reading is like 作る, which means "to make."

3066 | 涼む | すずむ | To Cool Oneself | To Cool Off | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

3067 | 届ける | とどける | To Deliver |  | 届く is "to be delivered." This word is when you're doing the actual delivering, making it to deliver.

It's no good delegating tasks if the person has no idea what to do, so be sure to make a list, okay?
3071 | 検討する | けんとうする | To Examine | To Study\n To Consider | You examine it but you also chastise it, because you want to make sure this examining is correct. This is to examine or to study.

3073 | 栄える | さかえる | To Flourish | To Prosper | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means flourish or prosper, so the verb vocab versions of these would be to flourish or to prosper. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What do you flourish at? You're an amazing soccer (さか) player who flourishes and prospers no matter where you go to play this wonderful (but not as good as baseball) sport.
3074 | 差し上げる | さしあげる | To Give | To Raise Up | This is a really humble and polite way to say "to give," probably because you're lowering yourself down and raising the item above your head so far that you have to point at it because if you were touching it you'd be defiling it anyways so, you know, point at it and raise it way up, you little worm on the ground. \n The reading is 差す and 上げる put together, both hopefully words you know okay by now.

3076 | 障る | さわる | To Irritate | To Annoy\n To Negatively Affect\n To Be Bad For | This is the verb version of hinder, but it's what happens when you hinder someone else enough.

Check out the Common Word Combinations for more examples! \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nIf you want to irritate me, all you have to do is make what I'm eating sour (さわ).

3079 | 占める | しめる | To Occupy | To Account For | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means occupy so the verb version is to occupy. \n What is it you want to occupy most in the whole, entire world? Your own flock of sheep (し). Also, a fortune teller (this kanji also means fortune, remember) told you that if you occupy her sheep, you'll have good luck! Gotta do as she says!
3080 | 過ごす | すごす | To Pass Time | To Spend Time | 過ぎる means "to pass," and 過ごす is to pass time.\n過ごす refers to how you live through or experience your time.

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nSomeone is trying to shake something. And unfortunately, that something is you. The most unfortunate thing here is that you're totally full (ふる), and you throw up because of the shaking (and you're full, gross!).
3083 | 担う | になう | To Take Responsibility | To Assume Responsibility\n To Take On A Burden | 担ぐ is more like when you're carrying something physical. 担う is when you carry a responsibility, which is why this word means to assume responsibility.

It's still used in phrases like "When I touched your hand," but has a lighter, more indirect and literary feel than 触る, which conveys a greater sense of purpose and intent behind the action.\n触れる is often used in constructions like 手がカバンに触れる (one's hand touches a bag), where が indicates what's doing the touching and に marks what's being touched. If you see を instead of が, 触れる becomes transitive, changing the meaning to "to have your hand touch a bag." \n The reading is totally different from 触る so don't let that fool you. In this case, you feel some fur (ふれ).

Asking why is very important if you want to understand the world. \n The reading for this is an exception. The reading for 何 is just the first な from なに.

Just think of all the people killed over this brush. This feud has to end.
3095 | 健忘症 | けんぼうしょう | Amnesia | Memory Loss\n Forgetfulness | A healthy bit of forgetting symptoms means you might have amnesia.\n健忘症 often refers to short-term memory loss, either full or partial, but some people might also use it in a sort of joking way for everyday forgetfulness. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
3119 | 中途半端 | ちゅうとはんぱ | Half Finished | Half Assed | Take the middle route, half to the edge. You don't do anything the full way. Just to the middle. Just to the half. Not to the edge. This was really half finished and half assed of you. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The ぱ at the end is the only tricky part here since that isn't a common reading (or the one you learned before) for the kanji. Just think of your ol' Pa (ぱ), who is the biggest half-asser you know.
3120 | 頭痛 | ずつう | Headache |  | Head pain is when you have a headache. \n The reading for 痛 should be okay. The reading for 頭 isn't one you've learned before, however. Just think, every time you go to the zoo (ず) you get a terrible headache. Must be the animal feces floating around in the air.

3124 | 居酒屋 | いざかや | Izakaya | Japanese Style Bar | An alive alcohol shop is a place that does a lot of alcohol. In Japan, these places are often izakaya, or, if you don't know Izakaya already from English, you can consider it to be a Japanese Style Bar. \n The readings here are all kun'yomi, but this is the first time you've seen the さか reading for 酒, which rendaku then turns into ざか in this word!

3129 | お任せ | おまかせ | Leaving Decisions To Someone Else | Chef's Choice\n Omakase | This word comes from 任せる, but without the る on the end it's a noun. You also have the honorific お on the beginning, which is a clue that you're addressing someone else. So you're entrusting something to the person you're talking to, and this means leaving decisions to someone else. This is used a lot in restaurants, where it means chef's choice or simply omakase. In other words, you're leaving the choice of food to the chef.\nIt can be used in other contexts, too, like if you leave your haircut up to your stylist or a flower arrangement up to the florist, or even if you follow the recommended program at the gym. \n You learned this reading with the word 任せる, so I'll leave this one to you.
3130 | 居間 | いま | Living Room | Sitting Room | A room that comes alive in intervals is your living room, or sitting room. You don't spend all your time in there, so it can only be alive sometimes.\nNote that 居間 is a little old-fashioned. These days, the more common word for a living room is リビングルーム. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own.
3131 | 理屈 | りくつ | Logic | Reasoning\n Argument | Reason yields to logic and more reasoning.\n理屈 can be neutral, but it often has negative connotations too, like when it refers to an argument that contains questionable logic, pretexts, or too much pedantry. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji.

3132 | 迷子 | まいご | Lost Child | Lost Person\n Stray Animal | A child that's astray is a lost child. Help them home, don't invite them into your windowless van, please. \n The reading for 迷 is an exceptional reading. The ご comes from こ. Think of the まい as the child asking: "Where is my (まい) mommy???"

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
3138 | 組織 | そしき | Organization |  | A group that's weaved together so tightly with hierarchy and everything else is a little more complicated than a group. It's an organization. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You didn't learn that reading for 組, so here's a mnemonic to help:\nYou start an organization for soap (そ). You're all about soap and making it more effective through your organization. So you call it the Soap Organization for Antiseptic Progress, or S.O.A.P. for short.
3139 | 痛い | いたい | Painful | Sore | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of pain? It's painful.\n痛い is commonly used to say that some part of the body hurts or feels sore. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.

3142 | 支度 | したく | Preparation | Getting Ready | To support yourself to some degree, you need preparation. Doing your hair and makeup in the morning supports your presentation to some extent, right?\nThis is another word for "preparation" besides 準備 and 用意. They’re all similar, but 支度 is usually used in personal contexts, such as 身支度 (getting dressed) or 旅支度 (getting ready for a trip). \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 度 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember them together:\nIn preparation for getting sheared, a sheep will sit on a tack (したく). This sheep tacking makes it so that the shearing part is nothing! Imagine watching some sheep getting ready by sitting on tacks. Yikes. You want to tell them being sheared doesn't hurt and that sheep tacking is worse, but something makes you think they won't listen to you.
3143 | 圧迫 | あっぱく | Pressure | Constriction\n Oppression | The pressure is urged upon you. It's the pressure, so much pressure!\n圧迫 refers to a tight pressure caused by strong compression, or to the act of pressing down itself. Figuratively, it can also mean constriction, like tuition fees putting a strain on a household budget, or oppression, such as people being subjugated. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The あつ turns into a small っ, and はく goes to ぱく.
3144 | 値段 | ねだん | Price | Cost | The value is in various steps. Each step is a different amount, and each amount is a price or cost.\n値段 refers to the price attached to something you can buy, like in stores or markets. For example, you could use 値段 to ask how much something costs at a shop or when talking about the price of a particular meal. \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading for 値 plus the on'yomi reading for 段. Combine them together to get the reading here. You've learned both of these readings already, so just remember 値 is ね because you neigh (ね) when you see a good price.
3145 | 貸し切り | かしきり | Private Reservation |  | The lending gets cut right away when you make a private reservation.\n貸し切り means reserving a space exclusively, like renting out a restaurant for a birthday party or chartering a bus, cruise, or jet. \n It's the reading of 貸す and 切る put together. Know those two readings and you know this one as well. Sometimes you'll see this word as 貸切り or 貸切 as well.
3146 | 建前 | たてまえ | Public Behavior | Public Stance\n Social Niceties | We all build up something in front of ourselves. It's the front we present to the world, the public behavior, public stance and social niceties that maintain harmony.\n建前 is very important in Japan. For example, you might find yourself invited to an acquaintance's home out of courtesy, with the expectation that you’ll decline (also out of courtesy!). A host of a party may say "just bring yourself," but guests know this could be 建前, and considering their own 建前, they bring a small gift anyways.  People can also be reluctant to say "no" to things, like drinks with coworkers when they really want to go home, and may not to show it when they find situations inconvenient or unpleasant. So you might need some guesswork to peek behind the 建前 that people build up in front of themselves! \n The reading is pretty strange. It's a lot like 建物 in that it's read as たて, which is like the word 建てる even though the て isn't showing here. So, you'll have to remember it's read like 建てる but the て gets pushed into the kanji.
3147 | 長靴 | ながぐつ | Rain Boots | Rubber Boots\n Riding Boots | Long shoes aren't long in that the feet part are long (that wouldn't make sense). Instead, the top part is long to keep you dry when it's raining. Yes, these are rain boots.\nIn modern Japanese, 長靴 is most commonly used to mean rain boots or rubber boots. It can occasionally mean riding boots as well. But if you're referring to fashion boots or boots in general, you can just call them ブーツ. \n The reading is a bit weird. Double kun'yomi, so think along the lines of 長い and 靴 getting added together. 靴 is the reading you learned with the kanji, however. It also gets rendaku'd.
3148 | 引退 | いんたい | Retiring | Retirement\n Withdrawing From Public Life | When you pull yourself back and retreat, you're retiring. At some point in everyone's lives you just can't do it anymore and it's time to take your retirement.\nThis word focuses on the moment of retiring. It's often used to mean withdrawing from public life, when someone ends their career in a particular field, like when celebrities or pro athletes retire. It can also be used for students who stop extracurricular activities like clubs and sports teams ahead of graduation, often to study for their exams. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 引 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nNow that you're retiring, you decide to go and spend your retirement at an inn (いん). Inns are great places to spend your retirement because everything is done for you, and you can just sit back and relax!
3149 | 巻きずし | まきずし | Rolled Sushi | Sushi Roll\n Makizushi | 巻く is "to roll." ずし is すし. This is rolled sushi. \n The reading comes from 巻く.
3150 | 誘惑 | ゆうわく | Seduction | Temptation | You're being invited, but you're also being misguided. This is seduction that's talking. A misguided invitation is never a good thing!\nThis word also translates to temptation, but keep in mind that 誘惑’s focus is more on an external factor that entices someone into succumbing to temptation. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
3151 | 切腹 | せっぷく | Seppuku | Ritual Suicide | When you cut your abdomen you are committing seppuku aka ritual suicide. It will help if you already know the word "seppuku" from English, as it is the reading. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. But it's got shortening and rendaku going on, so you have to remember those if you want to get it right. Or just know the word seppuku already since it's pretty popular. That works too.
3152 | 靴 | くつ | Shoes |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. Huzzah!
3153 | 靴屋 | くつや | Shoe Store | Shoe Shop\n Shoemaker's Shop | A shoes shop is one that sells shoes. It's a shoe store or shoe shop. \n The readings are the ones you learned with the kanji.
3154 | 睡眠 | すいみん | Sleep |  | Feeling drowsy and like I want to sleep. I just want to sleep so bad. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
3155 | 眠い | ねむい | Sleepy |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of sleep? It's sleepy. \n You're so sleepy you can't even remember your own name (ねむ).

3157 | 靴下 | くつした | Socks |  | What's below your shoes? Your socks. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji. You've learned them already, so you should be able to read this word too!
3158 | 暇 | ひま | Spare Time | Free Time\n Not Busy | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n暇 means the spare time or free time you have when you're not busy with work, school, or other obligations. It can also indicate a slow period for a business or a time when you have nothing to do, often suggesting a sense of boredom. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\nIn your spare time you like to drink hima (ひま), an off brand version of Zima.
3159 | 春巻き | はるまき | Spring Rolls |  | 巻く is "to roll up." If you roll up spring, you get a roll that's spring flavored. These are known as spring rolls. \n The readings come from 春 and 巻く.

Don't get this confused with the similar word 段階, which is the stairs making up the floors to a certain stage. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
3162 | 胃 | い | Stomach |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nJust keep in mind 胃 is specifically for the internal organ "stomach," not for the general abdominal area "stomach." \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
3163 | 胃痛 | いつう | Stomachache |  | When your stomach hurts you have yourself a little stomachache.\nTry to remember this isn't for general abdominal pain. 胃痛 is specifically for pain or discomfort in the stomach (the internal organ) — a literal stomachache. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

3165 | 供給 | きょうきゅう | Supply | Supplying | Your servant gets a nice salary because the supply of available servants is so small these days.

You wouldn’t use it for art supplies or the food you buy every day. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
3166 | 症状 | しょうじょう | Symptom |  | Your symptom condition is your symptoms that you have. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
3167 | 〜症 | しょう | Syndrome | Disease | Multiple symptoms combine to make a syndrome. If you see this at the end of a word, you know it means "______ syndrome," or else indicates some kind of health condition.\n〜症 is used in medical terms for certain health conditions, symptoms, or syndromes, like 熱中症 (heatstroke) or 認知症 (dementia). \n Since this is attached to things, it's treated like a jukugo word, so the on'yomi reading is used here.
3168 | 第一段 | だいいちだん | The First Step | First Step | 第一 means "the first," and 段 is a step. So, this is the first step. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

3171 | 従える | したがえる | To Be Accompanied By | To Have In Tow\n To Take Along | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means obey, but the verb meaning is a bit different. In most contexts, it often just means to be accompanied by someone or to have in tow. To help you remember this, imagine that everyone you're accompanied by obeys you! You're sort of their leader, so you go everywhere with them following in tow.\n従える is a relatively formal word that's often used in literature. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading with 従う. Remember it?
3172 | 退院する | たいいんする | To Be Discharged | To Leave The Hospital | Time to retreat from the institution.

So as long as you know that you know this as well.
3174 | 掛かる | かかる | To Be Hung | To Be Hooked\n To Be Caught | Remember how 掛ける is "to hang something"? 掛かる is the intransitive version where something just hangs. At some point it decided to be hung, and now it's hanging there. You know this because there is a car (かる) hanging there on the wall. You certainly didn't hang it, that would be impossible. It's just hanging by itself.\nThis word can also mean to be hooked, both for the car that got hooked to the wall and for the fish that happened to be caught on a hook. \n The reading is the same as 掛ける, so as long as you know that you know this too.
3175 | 属する | ぞくする | To Belong To | To Fall Under | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means belong so the verb vocab version is to belong to.\n属する is a formal term for describing someone or something’s belonging to or being part of a group, category or classification. \n The reading is the one you learned with the kanji. This kanji is going to belong to you.
3176 | 屈む | かがむ | To Bend Down | To Crouch\n To Duck\n To Squat | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means yield, and 屈む means to bend down or to crouch. After all, bending down and crouching are sort of like yielding to gravity, don’t you think?\n屈む refers to the act of lowering your head or body, so it can also mean to duck or to squat depending on the context. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou always have to bend down to get into your car garage (かが) because you’re just too tall. You have to crouch just to get inside your car garage! Let’s hope you can find a bigger one someday.
3177 | 捕える | とらえる | To Catch | To Capture\n To Seize\n To Grab | Remember how you learned 捕まる is "to be caught." Well this is the transitive version, so it means to catch or to capture. You (or someone else) is doing the catching, which is better than being the one who gets caught, I suppose. \n The reading is also not the same as 捕まる. Sorry! It does have a similar reading to 取る though, which also has to do with grabbing things (like grabbing onto an idea, for example). You can use 取る as a jumping off point for remembering the reading of this word. You might also find it useful to think back to 捉える, which has to do with mentally "catching" or "grasping" things. You'll sometimes see this written as 捕らえる as well.
3178 | 抜ける | ぬける | To Come Out | To Fall Out | Remember how 抜く means "to pull something out"? 抜ける describes something coming out of where it was, so it means to come out or to fall out.\nThis can be used for air coming out of a balloon, hair falling out, or pages missing from a book. It also means passing through places or leaving a group you were a part of.\nTo distinguish this word from 抜く, imagine a bunch of kale (ける) coming out of the ground on its own! Nobody pulled it out, it just came out by itself. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. Also, it is the same as 抜く.
3179 | 比較する | ひかくする | To Compare |  | 比較 is comparison. So, verb version of that? It's to compare. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Will help a lot to know the word 比較 as well.
3180 | 締結する | ていけつする | To Conclude | To Enter Into | When you tighten things up and bind things together, it's hard to separate them again. That's why this word is used to conclude or to enter into important agreements, like treaties and contracts.\nNote that this word is quite formal, which makes sense, given the contexts it’s usually used in. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
3181 | 怒る | おこる | To Get Angry | To Get Mad | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means angry, the verb vocab version is to get angry. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're starting to get angry about something. It's mostly this okra (おこ). It tastes terrible.

The kanji means pure, but this is an adjective that often describes behavior or character, so it means honorable, dignified, or gracious.\nHow does that work? I guess if you can stay pure despite a tough situation, you must be pretty honorable and dignified. You're the type who can make a gracious apology (潔い謝り), have a dignified manner (潔い態度), or even die honorably (潔く死ぬ).\n潔い is about being strong and doing the right thing without hesitation, especially when it's hard. For example, when someone admits their mistake honestly or handles a tough situation with courage, you can say they're 潔い. It's a way to praise someone for being straightforward and admirable in difficult times. \n Oh man, the reading for this is... like... crazy. First part can be something like it's soggy (いさぎ)... then the second part is like the word 良い (good). So, you can think of a honorableperson eating soggy cereal. They're so gracious that it doesn't matter to them how soggy it is. In fact, they accept it with dignity! They keep saying "it's soggy... 良い!" over and over again while eating the terribly soggy food.

One is the "not so good" meaning, and the other is the "delicate" meaning. Lately the "not so good" meaning has taken priority, I think, so let's focus on that for now. Something is both delicate and strange. This delicate strange thing really is just not so good. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. It's just not so good. Why?

3322 | 極める | きわめる | To Reach The Peak Of Something | To Perfect\n To Reach The Extreme | The kanji itself means extreme. The verb vocab version isn't "to extreme" because that wouldn't make sense.

3426 | 積もる | つもる | To Accumulate | To Get Piled Up | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means accumulate and the verb version is to accumulate. \n If something accumulates, you can start with one, but you need at least two (つ) things to say it has accumulated. If you don't, then there's nothing accumulating at all.
3427 | 怒らせる | おこらせる | To Anger Someone | To Provoke\n To Offend Someone | Remember how you learned that 怒る means "to get angry?" Well this is when someone else gets angry and it's because YOU made them angry. It means to anger someone. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned 怒る, so you should know this one too!
3428 | 添える | そえる | To Append | To Accompany\n To Garnish | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means append, so the verb vocab version is to append. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.

3430 | 昇る | のぼる | To Ascend | To Rise | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means ascend so the verb vocab version must be to ascend, or to rise. \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading, but it's pretty easy. How do you read all the other "to climb" words? 登る is one example. 上る is another. They're all のぼる, and so is this. Unlike the other climbing words, though, this suggests there's no effort involved. That's why you're "ascending" and not climbing, because climbing is a bit of work.
3431 | 壊す | こわす | To Break Something | To Break | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means break so the verb vocab version is to break something, because you're doing the breaking.

Both words are pretty common, but 任す is slightly less common than 任せる.\nHere's the mnemonic again, just in case you need a refresher:\nIf you pass a duty on to someone, that means you're going to entrust something to that person, or you're going to delegate something. In other words, you're going to leave something to them, so that they do it for you. \n This uses the same reading you learned with 任せる.
3433 | 診る | みる | To Examine A Patient | To Examine | In order to diagnose a patient, you must first go to examine a patient. When you examine them you know what's wrong with them and then you can diagnose them, which is why this verb is to examine. \n The reading is the same as 見る, which you have to do when you are examining a patient. So, you look and see all you can about the patient while you examine them, making this reading み as well.
3434 | 就く | つく | To Get A Position | To Get A Job | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means get a position. The verb vocab version is to get a position, or to get a job.\nNote that 就く is used with another word that indicates a position or a job, like 王位に就く(becoming a king) or 仕事に就く (finding employment). \n If you want to get a position, there are two (つ) interviews.

The たつ becomes だつ, though.
3438 | 見極める | みきわめる | To Get To The Bottom Of | To Identify Something | 極める is "to carry to extremes." If you take the action of seeing something to the extremes, you're going to get to the bottom of whatever it is.

Get to the bottom of this word and learn it.
3439 | 相次ぐ | あいつぐ | To Happen Successively | To Happen One After Another | Things that happen mutually right next to each other are said to happen successively. In other words, to happen one after another. \n Since this word consists of kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi readings. You've learned this reading for 相, but not for 次. Instead of giving you a mnemonic, we think it's easier to remember that 次ぐ being read つぐ comes from the 次 reading つぎ. Not too hard! All in all, that makes this あいつぐ.
3440 | 誘う | さそう | To Invite | To Tempt\n To Entice | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means invite.

If it's an invitation to something tempting, it can also mean to tempt, or to entice. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You saw so (さそ) much in this person that you decided to invite them to dinner.
3441 | 豚カツ | とんかつ | Tonkatsu | Breaded Pork Cutlet | 豚 comes from 豚肉 (pork), and カツ comes from the word "cutlet" and means just that. And a pork カツ is what any Japanese food fan will probably know as simply tonkatsu, a.k.a. breaded pork cutlet.\n豚カツ is a Japanese pork cutlet coated in crispy panko breadcrumbs and deep-fried, making it light and crunchy. It's usually served with a tasty sweet-savory sauce. It's so good, you'll pig out on it! \n This word uses the on'yomi of 豚.

3445 | 詰める | つめる | To Stuff In | To Cram In | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means stuffed, this word means to stuff in, as in you're doing the stuffing. You know that this is the case because when it comes to the mail (める), you stuff that mail into the garbage as hard as you can (it's all junk). \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned that reading with the kanji, so you should have no troubles here.
3446 | 請ける | うける | To Take | To Undertake\n To Accept\n To Receive | A person requests something, so you are the one to take it. You're really nice to accept their request. What a nice person you are! \n What's another word for "to accept" or "to receive"? How about 受ける? They share a reading!

3448 | 促す | うながす | To Urge | To Pressure | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means urge so the verb vocab version is to urge. \n Someone with a weird accent is trying to urge you to eat "Unagah" (うなが). This person really means "unagi," and this person also doesn't realize how delicious unagi is (and thinks he's tricking you). You ask him what "Unagah" is. Go ahead and say it out loud.
3449 | 訪れる | おとずれる | To Visit |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means visit and the verb vocab version is also to visit.\nWhat makes it different from 訪ねる, though? With 訪ねる, you're going somewhere or visiting someone with a clear purpose. With 訪れる, the emphasis is on the act of visiting a place (and not a person), regardless of purpose. So, if you're simply saying that you're going to go visit the Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto, you could say 訪れる. On the other hand, if you're visiting the Kiyomizu Temple to discover something, or you're going to pay a visit to a teacher in Kyoto for some advice, you could use 訪ねる.\nThose uses we just described for 訪れる are for when it is transitive. However, it can also be intransitive, if the action is done by something rather than someone. In that case, it means "to come", as in "winter comes" (冬が訪れる) or "peace comes" (平和が訪れる). 訪ねる, on the other hand, cannot be used in this way. \n The reading isn't the same as 訪ねる, though, I'm afraid. It's おとず. Remember how this means just visiting a place? Unfortunately, you completely forgot what you were visiting. When you finally remember, it's because you were looking down to think. It's to look at the toes of the giant Buddha statue. "Oh Toes!" (おとず), you exclaim.

You're used to seeing nice white rice, so seeing rice look any other way is really strange for you. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for 米 so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThe biggest problem when you buy unpolished rice is the mice (まい)! Mice like to eat and sleep in unpolished rice, so you have to be careful when you buy a bag that you get rid of all the sleeping mice before you try to cook it.
3453 | 催促 | さいそく | Urge | Press For\n Demand | I'm so for this I'm willing to sponsor you. I am going to urge you to do this until you do it, so much so I'll give you money.

3631 | 我が国 | わがくに | Our Country |  | You learned that 我が means "our", so our country is simply our country.\nJust like 我が itself, this expression is somewhat old-fashioned and stylized. It comes up a lot in political discourse and other formal contexts. \n You learned this reading for 我 when you learned 我が. Just watch out for 国, which you might expect to rendaku here, but doesn't!

If you know the word ビル, you can think about how building work is always prolonged or delayed, to help you remember that this is intransitive. We never know why it's delayed, it just happens all by itself! \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\nLucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as 延ばす.

3661 | 徳川 | とくがわ | Tokugawa | Tokugawa Shogun | This is one of those words that makes more sense when you look at the reading. The "Virtue River" isn't some virtuous river, it's in fact the Tokugawa family name, also known as the Tokugawa Shogun. They ran Japan for a while, you know? \n The readings are 徳 and the vocab 川 put together into one word. Once you can read this, you'll know the meaning too, so focus on the reading for this one.
3662 | 徳島県 | とくしまけん | Tokushima Prefecture |  | The virtue island prefecture is Tokushima prefecture. The reading will give away the meaning of this one, so long as you knew "prefecture." \n The readings are the ones you learned with the individual kanji.

3734 | 酸素 | さんそ | Oxygen |  | The acid element is oxygen. In German it’s the same as in Japanese - it’s called “Sauerstoff”, including “sauer”, the word for “sour”. The noun version is “Säure” which means both “sourness” and “acid” (which again is the same in Japanese, the same kanji is used in both words). The word “oxygenium” in Greek/Latin literally means “acid maker”. Long ago chemists thought oxygen was a defining characteristic of acids, later they found out there are also acids without oxygen like hydrochloric/muriatic/salt acid and the defining characteristic actually is hydrogen. But the name stuck.\nOr you could just imagine all the oxygen you breathe has turned into acid (oh no!), and it sucks to breathe. Whatever works for you. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

It's a bath for anyone willing to pay, making it a public bath. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You don't know the on'yomi reading of 湯, though, so just think about how when you get in the public bath, you're in Tokyo (とう), because there are a lot of public baths in Japan, and Tokyo is the most well known city there.
3745 | 出版社 | しゅっぱんしゃ | Publishing Company | Publisher | If 出版 means publishing, then a company that does said publishing is a publishing company. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji.

3746 | 押しボタン | おしぼたん | Push Button |  | If 押し is push, and a ボタン is a button, then you have yourself a push button. \n The reading is the same as 押す.
3747 | 生卵 | なまたまご | Raw Egg |  | Remember how 生 can mean raw? Well, it does now. So, a raw egg? First of all, delicious. Second of all, it means raw egg. \n The reading is the vocab 生 and 卵 combined into one 生卵.
3748 | 訳 | わけ | Reason |  | This word takes the reason meaning of the kanji, making it reason. What's the reason for it having two meanings? I have no clue, but there must be a reason.\nWhile 理由 is the general term for reasons, 訳 tends to be more focused on the underlying reason or cause of something. It's also used when explaining a situation or when there's an implied need to justify or clarify something. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhat's your reason to wake (わけ) up this morning? Think about it. Now think of your reason to wake up tomorrow. What is it?
3749 | 恩賞 | おんしょう | Reward |  | A kindness prize is one that someone gives you out of kindness.

You should be able to read this on your own.
3750 | 桜 | さくら | Sakura | Cherry Tree\n Cherry Blossom | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
3751 | 衛星 | えいせい | Satellite |  | A defense star isn't really a star, but it is something shiny in the sky that can look like a star if it's bright enough.

It can also mean I'm afraid or I'm scared  too. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.

They're super scary, don't go near them.

3754 | 秘密 | ひみつ | Secret | A Secret | Secret and secrecy. Combine the two and you have quite the secret. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3755 | 密告 | みっこく | Secret Information |  | In secrecy you must announce this information. It's not for anyone to hear, it's secret information. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. The みつ goes to みっ.

3759 | 飾り気 | かざりけ | Showing Off | Affectation | If you decorate your spirit with a bunch of pretty things like streamers and balloons, people will think you're just showing off. Yes, you know your spirit is awesome, but everyone else doesn't want it pushed in their face with your over the top decorations. \n Since the first part of this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You've learned how to read the かざ part already with the 飾る vocabulary.\nThe second kanji uses the on'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading for 気 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nAt the height of showing off, you bend one arm to your hip and the other out in the air. You pretend to be a kettle (け). You show off your spirit to all your friends singing "I'm a little ke-ttle, short and stout. Here is my handle, here is my spout. EVERYONE LOOK HOW GREAT I AM!" Your kettle dance is sure to impress them.
3760 | 匂い | におい | Smell | Scent\n Odor | This the noun version of the kanji for smell. It also means smell, or scent!\nAlthough 匂う often implies something smells unpleasant, 匂い is more neutral and can refer to any kind of smell. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji, so you should be able to read it already!

You were so upset about this, that you decided to sue (す) the maker of this nasty sour thing.
3764 | 汚点 | おてん | Stain | Smudge | A dirty point is a little point of dirtiness on something. This is a stain or smudge. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

3766 | 厳しい | きびしい | Strict | Harsh\n Severe | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of strict? It is also strict. \n The most strict creature in Japan is the key bee (きび). Little key bees have to be very strict about locking the doors to their hive. If they aren't strict enough, the scary Japanese hornets will get in and kill them all. Have you seen those things? They're terrifying!

3768 | 背が高い | せがたかい | Tall |  | This is the words 背 and 高い put together to make one adjective. When your height is tall it means you are a tall person. This word is only used for tall people though, not anything else that's tall like a building or a tree. \n This word is actually two separate words combined with a particle. So, since you treat them like separate words, you read each of them with the kun'yomi readings (they are both single kanji words all alone). You've learned both of these readings before now, so you should be able to read this word already!
3769 | 照り焼き | てりやき | Teriyaki |  | You illuminate some food, then bake it. To illuminate it, you put on some shiny sauce. Sound familiar, in terms of a type of food? This is teriyaki, though I have to warn you it's quite different from the teriyaki you get in the west. \n The reading comes from 照る and 焼く. Put them together and you have something delicious.
3770 | 冷える | ひえる | To Be Chilled | To Get Cold | If 冷やす is "to chill something," then this would be the version where something is just chilled. You're not doing the action of chilling anything, it's just that way. You know this because if you get involved, there's always some kind of chilling error (える). So, you step back and let the fridge do its job without messing. \n The reading comes from 冷やす. Know that and you know this as well.
3771 | 浮かれる | うかれる | To Be Happy | To Be In High Spirits\n To Be Elated | 浮く means "to float," and 浮かれる draws on that metaphor of "floating" to mean to be happy, to be in high spirits, or to be elated. We have the same metaphor in English — think of being "on cloud nine." \n The reading comes from 浮く, so if you know that you' are going to be happy and you won't have a care (かれる) in the world!
3772 | 秘める | ひめる | To Conceal | To Keep Secret | If you secret something, you are trying to keep secret something. That, or you're trying to conceal it. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, strangely enough. Nothing to conceal about this reading, you gots it.
3773 | 染める | そめる | To Dye |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means dye so the verb vocab version is to dye. \n You need to dye something that you just sewed (そ) together. It's all sewed and looks like a shirt, but it's colorless. That's where the dying comes in.
3774 | 火照る | ほてる | To Feel Hot | To Flush\n To Burn | If fire illuminates your face, you're going to feel hot. Sometimes you start to flush when you're embarrassed and it just feels like there is fire making your face light up. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You haven't learned this reading for 火 yet, but it's easier to remember this with a mnemonic for the whole thing:\nWhen are you going to feel hot? When is your face going to flush? When I ask you to go to a hotel (ほてる) with me!
3775 | 採る | とる | To Gather | To Take\n To Pick | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means gather so the verb vocab version is to gather. \n When you gather things, you go around and take things from their original location to put them together in your gathering spot. In Japanese, when you take something, you could say 取る, right? This word has the same reading: とる.
3776 | 汚れる | よごれる | To Get Dirty | To Get Polluted\n To Become Dirty | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means dirty so the verb vocab version is to get dirty. You know you're not doing the dirtying, because it's rare (れる) for you to get anything dirty, though things do get dirty on their own. \n Things seem to get dirty easily around here, which is why you go (よご) to great lengths to keep things clean.\nNote that the reading よごれる is generally used for getting physically dirty, whereas けがれる is more figurative, so more like “to be defiled”.
3777 | 濡れる | ぬれる | To Get Wet | To Be Wet | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means wet, so the verb version is to get wet. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji, so you should be able to read it already!
3778 | 越す | こす | To Go Beyond |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means go beyond so the verb vocab version is also to go beyond.\nThis is very similar in meaning to 越える. Both can refer to overcoming some physical object or passing beyond a certain amount of time. However, 越す tends to sound a little less intense, while 越える really focuses on the physical or emotional challenge of overcoming a certain milestone. For example, while 山を越す simply refers to crossing a mountain, 山を越える gives the impression that crossing the mountain is a difficulty you've overcome. \n The reading is the same as 越える. So if you know that you know this too! In case you need a reminder, here's the mnemonic:\nTo go beyond child (こ) years in order to become an adult, you have to be 18 years old in the USA, and 20 years old in Japan.
3779 | 飼う | かう | To Keep A Pet | To Raise A Pet\n To Own A Pet | The kanji is domesticate. When you domesticate an animal, you get to keep a pet of some kind. You'd use this to describe when you are keeping a dog or cat or something. \n The reading is the one you learned with the kanji. The か of cat!
3780 | 漏らす | もらす | To Leak Something | To Leak | If 漏れる is "to leak," then this is when you do the leaking yourself. The reason this thing is leaking, though (and it shouldn't be), is because you rushed (らす) the job (because you did it yourself), which is why you know this is to leak something. \n The reading comes from 漏れる, so if you know that, you know this! Don't let that memory leak from your head.
3781 | 預かる | あずかる | To Look After | To Take Care Of\n To Hold On To | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThe kanji itself means deposit, and you already learned a similar word that means the same thing as the kanji, 預ける. With this verb, someone is depositing something (or someone) with you, because they want you to look after, to take care of, or to hold on to it.\nTo differentiate it with 預ける, think of the か in 預かる. The only thing you're willing to look after is your car (か), and nothing else! Someone asks you to look after their kids? Sorry, nothing doing, you're busy taking care of your car. Can you hold on to someone's luggage for them? Nope, your car takes priority. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this before with the pair verb 預ける, but here's a mnemonic to remind you just in case:\nYou need someone to look after your kids for the day. Hey, I have an idea! Leave them with the monkeys at a zoo (あず)! Monkeys love kids, and kids love monkeys. Now you can zoom off in your cars (か) for the day!
3782 | 結婚する | けっこんする | To Marry | To Get Married | 結婚 is marriage, so the verb version of that would be to marry or to get married. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. It will help to know 結婚 first, though.
3783 | 迎える | むかえる | To Pick Someone Up | To Meet Someone\n To Welcome\n To Invite | The kanji means welcome, but the verb version is to pick someone up or to meet someone. That's weird. But, think of it this way: When you go to welcome someone, you are going to meet someone too. You have to go somewhere to wait and welcome them, which is why you are going to pick someone up or going to meet them. Something like that anyways. \n To pick someone up you are going to drive your moo car. It's a car that's designed to look like a cow, but you think it will be a nice way to welcome your friend.
3784 | 延長する | えんちょうする | To Prolong | To Extend | If 延長 is prolonging, then the verb version is to prolong. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3785 | 出版する | しゅっぱんする | To Publish |  | If 出版 is publishing, then the verb vocab version is to publish. \n The reading comes from 出版, so if you know that you know this. Also, it's just the kanji readings too, so no problemo for a person like you, I'm sure.
3786 | 購読する | こうどくする | To Subscribe |  | If 購読 is a subscription, then the verb vocab version would be to subscribe. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3787 | 似合う | にあう | To Suit | To Match | It resembles you! It suits you! Wow, your good looks really cause this scarf to suit you, you know? \n The reading is from 似る and 合う, put together.
3788 | 捨てる | すてる | To Throw Away | To Abandon | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means throw away so the verb version is to throw away. \n The reading is the one you learned with the kanji, so no need to throw away that bit of knowledge just yet!
3789 | 訳す | やくす | To Translate |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means translate so the verb version would be to translate. \n The reading for the kanji part is surprisingly the やく you learned with it, even you wouldn't expect that. I suppose that's the kind of thing you have to look forward to if you were to go into translating.
3790 | 訳語 | やくご | Translated Term |  | A translated bit of language is a translated term. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

3794 | 欲しい | ほしい | Wanted | Desired\n Want | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of want? It's also wanted. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What do you want? A hoe (ほ), like a garden hoe, you sicko.
3795 | 欲求 | よっきゅう | Wants | Desires\n Craving | What you want and request are your wants, your desires, perhaps your craving. You want these things so you request them. I wants them! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. よく goes to よっ, so be careful not to want the wrong reading.
3796 | 温暖 | おんだん | Warm | Mild\n Warmth | Warm warm is warm. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3797 | 暖かい | あたたかい | Warm | Mild | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of warm? It's warm as well! Though this is for a warm weather or temperature, not some warm food or something like that, that would be 温かい, a different あたたかい. Confusing, right? \n The reading is the same as 温かい, which also means warm. But while that 温かい refers to a warm thing, this 暖かい refers to a warm temperature or place.\nJust like with 温かい, people often pronounce this as あったかい in conversation. But when it comes to kanji exams or typing out the kanji, remember to use あたたかい!
3798 | 白旗 | しろはた | White Flag |  | A white flag is a white flag. It's one for surrender. I give up! Too many kanji! \n The most common reading for this is the vocab kun'yomi readings put together to make しろはた. The other two readings are much less common, so I'd recommend focusing on しろはた!
3799 | 意志 | いし | Will | Volition | You have an idea and you have intent to carry it out. This is your will and volition. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3800 | 意欲 | いよく | Will | Desire\n Ambition | If you have an idea of what you want already, then that's good! You have will, desire, and ambition. Those who don't know what they want can't have any of these. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3801 | 傷 | きず | Wound | Damage\n Flaw | The kanji and the word are exactly the same.

To this type of person, your announcement would come in the form of advice or maybe admonishment, if you're upset with what they've done. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3805 | 裏通り | うらどおり | Alley | Back Street | A backside street (or "avenue") is a street that's not a main street... it's hidden and behind everything, making it an alley. \n The reading is 裏 and 通り put together into one word.

What do you do that is annual?\n年次 is a formal term typically used in business settings, such as in 年次報告書 (annual report) or 年次休暇 (annual leave). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

If nothing’s shaking, things must be sluggish.\n不振 is used for times when things are slower or worse than usual.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
3811 | 装い | よそおい | Attire | Dress\n Garb | This looks like it's an adjective, but it's just a tricky word. It's a noun, and it means the same thing as the kanji, making it attire. \n "Yo, so, oh, you gonna wear that attire today or what?"
3812 | 服装 | ふくそう | Attire | Dress | Your clothes which attire you is your attire. It's how you dress. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

3819 | 熟語 | じゅくご | Compound Word | Compound Kanji\n Jukugo | Ripened languages are words that have taken some time to come into their form.

That's how we'll do this enlargement, expansion and extension. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

Imagine something that it does to your attire. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3830 | 除いて | のぞいて | Except |  | 除く is "to exclude." This is the te-form, and it means "except." So, something like "please get everything except broccoli," because who wants broccoli? \n The reading comes from 除く. It's just the te-form of it.

3832 | 屁 | へ | Flatulence | Gas\n Fart | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n You already learned this reading with the kanji, so you should be good to go!
3833 | 居候 | いそうろう | Freeloader | Lodger Who Pays Nothing | To stay alive in some climates, some have no choice but to be a freeloader. That is, a lodger who pays nothing. If you live somewhere with an inhospitable climate but you can't afford to pay rent, your only option is to live with someone for free. \n This is a slightly unusual case because both kanji use the kun'yomi. You haven't learned that reading for 候 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhat? You've become a freeloader? I can't believe you've gone so low (そうろう)!
3834 | 貨物船 | かもつせん | Freighter | Freight Ship | A freight things ship is a boat that freights things. It's a freighter. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. The 物 takes its もつ reading, which makes sense since it sounds like 持つ, which is "to hold." What is this freighter doing? It's holding freight!

3835 | 果糖 | かとう | Fructose |  | A fruit sugar is the type of sugar that's more commonly known as fructose. Mmm, delicious fructose. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

It's also used in phrases like 学びの園, which means "school" and carries the connotation of being a haven for learning. \n This word uses the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhich garden is the Garden of Eden? その garden! That garden right next to you is the Garden of Eden!\nIt can also use the on'yomi, though, which you've already learned. When it takes the on'yomi and is used as a standalone word, it usually refers to some kind of institution, like a 幼稚園.

3838 | 華々しい | はなばなしい | Gorgeous | Flamboyant\n Brilliant\n Remarkable | 華やか is "showy." Now we're doubling it, making it doubly showy.

3839 | 墓場 | はかば | Graveyard |  | A grave location is a place where there are graves. It is a graveyard.\nThis word is more direct and informal than 墓地, so using 墓場 for an actual cemetery might come off as disrespectful. It's commonly used in phrases like ゆりかごから墓場まで (from the cradle to the grave) or 墓場まで持っていく (take a secret to the grave). \n This word uses the kun'yomi for both kanji, which is fairly unusual, but then graveyards are unusual and special places. You've learned both of these readings before, so you should be able to read this on your own, but here's a reminder for 墓 just in case:\nWhen you're finally dead and buried in a graveyard, your one wish is for the New Zealand All Blacks to do the Haka (はか) over your grave. If you don't know what the haka is, look it up, it's pretty neat.
3840 | 灰色 | はいいろ | Gray | Gray Color | Ash color tends to be a kind of gray color, wouldn't you say? That makes this word gray (or grey, depending on where you're from). \n This is a jukugo word that uses the kun'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

3843 | 家賃 | やちん | House Rent | Rent | Your house rent is your house rent, though it can be your apartment rent too. \n The reading for 家 is an exceptional one. It is や, because when your landlord asks if you paid your rent, you always say yah (や), whether you did or not.
3844 | 屁理屈 | へりくつ | Illogical Argument | Far-Fetched Argument\n Lame Excuse | You already know that 理屈 means "theory". So what's flatulence theory? It's an illogical argument, a far-fetched argument, or sometimes a lame excuse. It's all just hot air! \n You've already learned all these readings. You should be able to read this on your own. And no, that's not a far-fetched argument, or a lame excuse for not writing a mnemonic.
3845 | 真似 | まね | Imitation | Mimicry\n Impersonation | You're taking reality and trying to resemble it. To do this, you have to do an imitation, mimicry, or an impersonation. \n This word uses the kun'yomi reading for 真 and an irregular reading for 似. You've already learned the reading for 真, but here's a mnemonic to help you with 似:\nWhat are you doing an imitation of? A horse! You gallop around neighing (ね) at the top of your lungs! That's a pretty good imitation.
3846 | 皇族 | こうぞく | Imperial Family | Member Of The Imperial Family | The emperor's tribe is his family. This family is known as the imperial family. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

You should be able to read this on your own.
3848 | 地蔵 | じぞう | Jizo | Jizou | The ground storehouse refers to a person's name. It may be easier to learn this one reading first because of that. Anyways, this person is Jizo(u), a Bodhisattva, and protector of children. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3849 | 散らし | ちらし | Leaflet | Handbill\n Flyer\n Scattering | What do people usually scatter in a rush (らし)? Leaflets and flyers. Handing them out takes way too much time, so if you just scatter them all over the place your job will be done so much faster! \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned the 散る, so you should be able to read it already!\nNote that this word is almost always written in kana, and チラシ is much more common than ちらし.
3850 | 肺 | はい | Lung |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. OH HAI THERE LUNG. OH HAI THERE YOU.
3851 | 肺がん | はいがん | Lung Cancer |  | 肺 is lung, がん is "cancer," I suppose because you want it gone (がん) from you. That makes this word lung cancer, which, with all the smoking in Japan, happens a decent amount. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji.
3852 | 肺病 | はいびょう | Lung Disease |  | A lung sickness is bad for those lungs of yours. It means you have lung disease. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3853 | 雑誌 | ざっし | Magazine |  | Random magazine is pretty much all magazines. Just a bunch of random stuff inside, making it a magazine. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3854 | 温厚 | おんこう | Mild-Mannered | Gentle\n Good-Natured | When a warm temper is applied extra thick, it leads to a person having a mild-mannered or gentle personality.\nNote that this is a more formal term, so you'll usually encounter it in writing. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You already know the on'yomi for 温, but not for 厚, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:\nThe most mild-mannered Tofugu staff has to be onion こういち. It's an onion that jumps in for こういち whenever he's not at the office. He's the most gentle soul you could imagine, never yelling at anyone. The ideal boss, really.
3855 | 沢 | さわ | Mountain Stream | Swamp | The kanji and the word share the meaning of swamp, but this word is primarily used to mean mountain stream. Think of it this way, the water for a swamp has to come from somewhere right? It starts out up in the mountains and drains out into a swamp in the valley. The life cycle of a mountain stream into a swamp! \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: The beginning of the word swamp is actually pretty similar to this word's reading. さわ = "swa"? I'd say it's close enough to make a mnemonic out of in your head.
3856 | 筋肉 | きんにく | Muscle |  | Your muscle meat is your muscle. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3857 | 天然 | てんねん | Natural |  | Something of heaven's nature is indeed natural, with no human intervention involved.\nAlthough this word is technically a noun, it's often used as an adjective. That's also what distinguishes it from 自然. So you'll often see 天然 used to say that something is "natural" or "of nature", while 自然 will often be used to talk about nature in general, like saying that nature is beautiful. \n You know the reading for 天, but 然 uses a different reading from what you learned. So here's a mnemonic to help you:\nOne thing that definitely isn't natural are nendoroids (ねん). Remember, the little plastic figurines? Have you ever seen an anime figurine growing naturally in a field before? Yup, me neither. Not very natural.
3858 | 否 | いな | No | Not | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nNote that 否  ( いな ) is very formal and somewhat archaic. Today, it's most commonly used in the expression  〜か否か  (whether… or not). \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nInstead of saying "no" you say "na," and instead of saying "na" you say いな.\nNote that 否 can also be read いや, which is a common way to say “no” in modern Japanese, but that reading is almost always written in kana.
3859 | 操作 | そうさ | Operation | Handling\n Manipulation | If you manipulate the things you make, you are in operation of said things.\nThis can not only refer to the operation of devices and machinery, but also the manipulation of various elements, such as markets, stock prices, and more, with the intention of furthering one's own interests. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

3863 | 泥沼 | どろぬま | Quagmire | Bog\n Morass | A muddy bog is a way of describing a quagmire. It’s a bog with almost no water left, having become all muddy and sticky. Gross (and dangerous)!\nThis word is typically used figuratively to describe a situation where a conflict becomes messy and difficult to resolve, or a problem from which it is difficult to extricate oneself. \n The readings are the vocab readings of the two words, 泥 and 沼.
3864 | 冷蔵庫 | れいぞうこ | Refrigerator | Fridge | A cool storehouse storage is a place you put things (like food) to keep them cool. This is a refrigerator. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

3866 | 著しい | いちじるしい | Remarkable | Marked | The kanji means author, but if you think about it, what do authors do?

On the other hand, while 物真似 also describes acts of mimicry and imitation, it's additionally used in performance or entertainment contexts to refer to people who do impersonation acts. \n The reading is 物 plus 真似 put together.
3952 | 不純 | ふじゅん | Impure |  | Not pure things are impure. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3953 | 内臓 | ないぞう | Internal Organ |  | Inside internal organs are your internal organs, though you'd think the second kanji would give a hint to that without the 内. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

That means you have the length and width and the vertical and horizontal. \n This is a jukugo word that usually uses the kun'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.\nNote however, that there is a less-common on'yomi reading,  じゅうおう, which is used in some idioms. It's good to know this reading exists, but you probably won't come across it very often.
3956 | 久しぶり | ひさしぶり | Long Time No See | It's Been A While | This is kind of a "set phrase" in Japanese, though we're going to treat it like a vocab word here (because it's so common and useful!). You know that 久 means "long time" - so now let's pay attention to the kana: しぶり. Just imagine that she buried you alive, then a few days later came back to dig you up. The first thing she says is "LONG TIME NO SEE!" \n You learned this reading when you learned 久しい. It's the same one!
3957 | 肺臓 | はいぞう | Lung |  | The lung internal organ is the lung. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
3958 | 磁石 | じしゃく | Magnet | A Magnet | A magnet stone is a magnet. Magnets look like little stones, right? \n The 磁 reading makes sense. The しゃく reading for 石 is an exception.

It pulls you towards the shack, and when you find it and open it, all the magnets fly out and crush you because of magnety reasons.
3959 | 磁場 | じば | Magnetic Field |  | A magnet location is an area with a magnetic field. \n The readings are the same as the ones you learned with the kanji.

3966 | 納豆 | なっとう | Natto | Fermented Soybeans | A supply of beans is when you take a bunch of beans, mash them up into a supply, and then ferment them all together to make them into natto (also known as fermented soybeans). \n The reading is an exceptional one. 豆 is okay, and is the on'yomi reading from the kanji. The 納 part is weird though. Instead of being のう it's なっ. But, if you can remember the meaning of this word, you can just think about how you do not (なっとう) want to eat natto. At least a lot of people don't want to eat it. It's quite the acquired taste.
3967 | 興味がない | きょうみがない | No Interest | Not Interested | 興味 is interest in something. If you do not have (がない) that interest, then you have no interest or you're not interested. \n You learned that the word 興味 uses the on'yomi readings for both kanji, so all you have to do is add が + ない and you've got a new expression!
3968 | 兄貴 | あにき | Older Brother | Big Brother\n One's Senior | The older brother is valuable to you. But, no matter how valuable he is to you, he's still just your older brother.\nP.S. You'll often see some gangstah thug call a higher ranking gangstah thug (one that acts like an older brother to all the other gangstah thugs) this. It's like family within the gang. \n The reading is 兄 on its own plus the reading for 貴. ANIKIIIII.
3969 | 源 | みなもと | Origin | Source\n Ground Spring | The origin is the origin, but it also refers to the ground springs, where the origin of water comes from. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Think of how this ground spring is everyone's (皆) origin (元). Everyone can use it, it's the 皆元!
3970 | 飼い主 | かいぬし | Pet Owner |  | You know that to 飼う is "to keep a pet." If you're the master that is keeping a pet (飼う), then you are the pet owner. \n The reading is the kun'yomi readings for both. You'll need to remember the words 飼う and 主 to be able to remember the reading of this word.

She'll take every valuable you have and destroy them.
3975 | 純粋 | じゅんすい | Pure | Genuine | You're pure and that's stylish, which makes you even more pure, somehow.

That means they share meanings as well.\nTo be exact, 丼 refers to a chinaware bowl that's bigger and sturdier than your ordinary rice bowl. It's often used for one-bowl dishes like katsudon, gyūdon, poke, but also noodle soups like ramen! \n You learned the どん reading for this kanji. This reading is just an extension of that, coming out to どんぶり. You can remember the ぶり part because you know what your favorite rice bowl is... it's a brie (ぶり) cheese rice bowl.

3987 | 染み | しみ | Stain | A Stain | This is the noun version of 染. A dye would seem like the right answer, but what else is a dye? If you get it on you when you don't want to get it on you, it becomes a stain. \n The reading is unlike what you learned with this kanji before. Just think about how you have this stain on your shirt, all because you were trying to dye some sheep (し) and they didn't like it. So now you have a big dye and sheep poo stain. How were you supposed to know sheep don't like being dyed?!
3988 | 粋 | いき | Stylish |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This word uses the kun'yomi reading, which you haven't learned yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou are stylish.

3995 | 申し込む | もうしこむ | To Apply | To Submit An Application\n To Propose | I must say humbly that I want to get into this position, so I'm planning to apply for it and to submit an application.\n申し込む isn't just about applying, though. It's about officially communicating desires, whether you want to propose marriage, challenge someone to a game of tennis, or even offer a donation to a good cause. \n The readings come from the word 申す and the kanji 込, stuck together... humbly.
3996 | 傷む | いたむ | To Be Damaged | To Go Bad\n To Spoil | The kanji means wound, and this verb is intransitive, so it means to be damaged or to go bad. After all, fruit with a wound on it is going bad, isn't it? \n This shares the same reading as 痛む. The meanings are similar too, so that should be easy to remember, unless your brain was damaged by these mnemonics or something.
3997 | 染まる | そまる | To Be Dyed |  | If 染める is "to dye," then this is to be dyed. You aren't doing the dying, because you know that if you did it you would have done things right, unlike the other person who dyed your hair. This person marred (まる) it up really bad. \n The reading is the same as 染める.
3998 | 勤める | つとめる | To Be Employed At | To Work For | The kanji is work which means this verb has something to do with working.

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou don't have a knife for your steak, so you have to carve it using the key zag (きざ) technique. You take a key and zag it through the steak repeatedly until you're able to cut up some zaggy bite-sized pieces.
4000 | 発揮する | はっきする | To Exhibit | To Demonstrate | Departure and brandish this thing. This means you're sending something out to show to everyone.

4004 | 承る | うけたまわる | To Humbly Hear | To Accept | Giving consent to someone is similar to humbly listening to and accepting their words.

Now, you are going to take that information that you received and then revolve it (回る) around in your head to think about it. Hmmm... hmm... Ok, I like what I'm hearing. I am going to accept what you said. Thank you.

This happens a lot. \n The reading comes from 汚れる, so if you know that you can read this.\nNote that the reading よごす  is generally used for making things physically dirty, whereas けがす means making someone or something impure in a figurative way.
4008 | 引っ越す | ひっこす | To Move | To Move Homes | 越す is "to go beyond." Now you're going beyond your home and pulling everything with you to go to another home. You are trying to move / to move homes. \n The readings come from 引く and 越す put together. Careful of that っ.
4009 | 追い越す | おいこす | To Overtake | To Surpass\n To Pass\n To Pull Ahead | 越す means "to go beyond." 追 is follow. If you are following someone, and then you go beyond them, you have overtaken them.

It can also be used when offering something, such as a drink. On the other hand, 薦める is used to recommend a person or thing as suitable for a particular situation, with a focus on endorsing the subject rather than a specific action. \n This has the same reading as 勧める, since they mean almost the same thing.
4013 | 腐る | くさる | To Rot |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means rot so the verb vocab version is to rot. \n Remember the word 臭い, which means "stinky"? When something rots, it becomes stinky, and all くさい.

He had to transform into cheese jesus (ちぢ), a more powerful version of himself, in order to shrink the monster down to size.
4016 | 詰め込む | つめこむ | To Stuff | To Cram | You know that 詰める is "to stuff in" and the kanji 込 is into.

4020 | 書き込む | かきこむ | To Write In | To Fill Out\n To Jot Down | You know that 書く is "to write" and the kanji 込 is into, so this means to write in, to fill out, or to jot down.\n書き込む focusses more on the physical action of writing than 書く on its own. This is because 込む stresses that you’re putting words INTO some space, either on paper or on computer. \n The reading comes from the word 書く and the kanji 込 combined into one.
4021 | 誤字 | ごじ | Typo |  | A mistake in letters is a typo. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
4022 | 貴い | とうとい | Valuable | Sacred | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of valuable? It's valuable. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What is most valuable to you? Of course it's your toe toe (とうと). It's your big toe (the long とう) with another small toe growing out of it (short と). Imagine your toe toe, and then imagine how valuable it is to you. So valuable! You can also think about 尊い, a similar word which means "revered." It's a similar idea, and it has the same reading.

4024 | 縦書 | たてがき | Vertical Writing | Vertical Style Writing | Vertical writing is vertical writing. That's when you see Japanese and it's written top to bottom instead of sideways. \n The readings are the reading you learned with the kanji 縦 and かき (changes to がき), though the き gets smushed inside the kanji, because it wants to be confusing like that.
4025 | 黒幕 | くろまく | Wirepuller | Mastermind\n Black Curtain | Just imagine a black curtain off in the background. You don't know what's behind it, but you know what's in front of it. Thing is, the thing in front of the curtain is controlled by whoever is behind the black curtain. This person is the wirepuller or mastermind of the situation. Like the Wizard of Oz, or something. \n The reading is the vocab readings for 黒 and 幕, though the vocab reading for 幕 is the same as the on'yomi reading, making things easy for you.
4026 | 貴様 | きさま | You |  | A valuable formal name ender. It's like saying something like "the valuable great you"... or something. Anyways, this means you, but it isn't as nice as it sounds. Probably a lot of irony and sarcasm going into this word, because if you use きさま to say "you" to someone, you're probably not pleased with that person, or you're just trying to be rude. \n The readings are the reading you learned with 貴 plus the vocab reading for 様.
4027 | 交互 | こうご | Alternately |  | You mix, then you go mutual, then you mix, and then you go mutual. Alternately, you could go mix again? \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

4091 | 総理府 | そうりふ | Prime Minister's Office | Cabinet Office | The prime minister's (総理) government is where he does all his governmenting. It's where the Japanese Prime Minister's Office (aka the Cabinet Office) is located as well.\n総理府 was actually renamed 内閣府 in 2001, so you'd generally only use 総理府 to talk about the Cabinet Offices from back in the day. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know 総理 beforehand as well.
4092 | 雨天 | うてん | Rainy Weather |  | You see the kanji for rain being followed by the 天 kanji from 天気 (weather). This word means rainy weather.\nThis has a formal nuance to it, and is often used for event announcements (whether to postpone it in case of rainy weather, etc). \n This is a jukugo word, so you use on'yomi readings. You should be familiar with the on'yomi reading for 天 already, but not for 雨. So here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\nThe rainy weather won't stop you to go catch some uni (う). You would get wet anyway diving into the ocean to collect uni, the rainy weather doesn't affect you. You can also sell them for ten (てん) bucks a piece! The rainy weather isn't at all a problem for a uni hunting if you're making ten dollars for each, you know?

You haven't learned these readings yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nJust remember that rising and getting out of bed early is the key (き) to the Shogun's (しょう) heart.

4097 | 海亀 | うみがめ | Sea Turtle |  | A sea turtle is a sea turtle. Cowabunga! \n The reading is the kun'yomi readings of these kanji, put together. I suppose it's because it's like two separate words put together into one. That makes this word read as うみがめ, where the かめ gets rendaku'd.
4098 | 自己 | じこ | Self | Oneself | Your self oneself, is your oneself or self. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
4099 | 自撮り | じどり | Selfie |  | A self photograph is exactly that: a selfie. \n This word uses the on'yomi of 自, which you learned with the kanji, and the kun'yomi of 撮, which you learned with the word 撮る. Though it's a bit of an unusual combo, you can probably guess the first one since it's such a common reading, and the second one because of the り on the end. Just watch out for rendaku, which turns とり into どり.
4100 | 真剣 | しんけん | Serious |  | The reality of the sword is that it will cut you right in half and kill you, easily. The fact that this is true is a very serious thing. Very serious. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

So many sevens, lucky! \n The readings are the on'yomi reading. You've seen the on'yomi reading of 喜 before, though it may be hard to remember at this point.

4106 | 一筋 | ひとすじ | Single Mindedly | Intently\n Earnestly\n A Line | You have one muscle, therefore it only does one thing. That's it. It is single mindedly doing that one thing. It is intently and earnestly doing that one thing. \n The reading is a bit weird. It's the kun'yomi readings, where 一 is ひと and 筋 is すじ. Look back on the vocab words that use these readings to remember this one.
4107 | 汁 | しる | Soup | Juice | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou are given some soup. You take a bite and your mouth is cut clean off. That is because you're eating sheer (しる) soup.
4108 | 寿司 | すし | Sushi |  | The lifespan of a director depends on how much sushi they eat.\nOkay, the kanji in 寿司 aren't actually related to the meaning of the word, so this one's kind of tricky. Just try to think of sushi as the secret to a long lifespan for directors. Imagine all those directors wolfing down a bunch of sushi because they're desperate to lengthen their lifespans. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.\nIt might also help to know the kanji in 寿司 are 当て字 (remember those?). They have nothing to do with sushi, so they're just being used here for their sound.
4109 | 剣 | けん | Sword | Sabre\n Double-Edged Sword | The kanji and the word are the same. That means they share meanings as well. This word covers all types of swords and sabres, though it was originally used mostly for double-edged swords. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!\nThis word can also be read つるぎ, but in that case its meaning is limited to Western-style swords only. Because of the meaning difference, we only accept the けん reading (but you'll get another try if you enter つるぎ).
4110 | 涙 | なみだ | Tears | Tear\n Teardrop | Your teardrops are also known as your tears. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji, but here's a mnemonic in case you need a refresher:\nYour teardrops are like little waves. What are they? They're 波だ (なみだ).
4111 | 酔う | よう | To Be Drunk | To Be Seasick\n To Be Carsick | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means drunk so the verb vocab version is to be drunk.\nThis drunk feeling also happens to some people in boats and cars. But we call that to be seasick or to be carsick. You aren't actually drunk, but you feel like you are (and you're probably gonna puke, yuck!). \n I'm not drunk, yo (よ). YO. I'm not drunk, yo. YO. Yo, I'm not drunk. Yo.
4112 | 勇む | いさむ | To Be In High Spirits | To Be Eager | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means courage so the verb version is what happens when you have lots of it. Someone with courage is probably the kind of person who is able to be in high spirits in the face of something!\n勇む means to be eager to face something or to face it with bravery and determination. It often indicates proactive and enthusiastic engagement. You'll find it in written expressions like 喜び勇む (to joyfully and eagerly undertake something) or 勇んで出かける (to go out with determination). \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWho is the one person who always seems to be in high spirits? Isabel (いさ)! She's so positive and eager, even in the face of a challenge.
4113 | 鑑みる | かんがみる | To Be In Light Of Something | To Take Something Into Account | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means model, and the verb version means things like to be in light of something or to take something into account. If something is your model, you're taking it into account, and it's in light of it that you make your decisions.\nThis verb is transitive, meaning that it can take a direct object, but you'll probably see it used more with the particle に. It's a pretty formal word so you'll mostly come across it in official, written contexts. \n This verb uses the kun'yomi of the kanji. You haven't learned that yet, so here's mnemonic to help you:\nIf you want to take something into account, you'll need to 考える (かんが) about it really hard first. Please think about it really, really carefully, because it's bound to be in light of something, and we need to know what that something is.
4114 | 遅れる | おくれる | To Be Late |  | If something or someone is slow, and they "do slow" they are going to be late. \n What is slow and probably going to be late all the time? A big oak (おく). Oaks have trouble moving, and are slow, and therefore are always late, too.
4115 | 滞る | とどこおる | To Be Overdue | To Be Delayed | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means stagnate, and the verb vocab version is to be overdue. After all, if something stagnates, it's not advancing, which causes it to be delayed. \n Your work tends to be overdue, so you get a lot of to-do calls (とどこおる) from your boss, reminding you to do your work. These calls are pretty annoying, but at least your work is less delayed.
4116 | 算定する | さんていする | To Calculate |  | When you calculate and determine (the calculation), you are determining the calculation.

4118 | 垂れる | たれる | To Dangle | To Drip | If 垂らす is "to dangle something" then this is to dangle or to drip. You're not doing the dangling, which is rare (れる), because usually it's you who's doing the dangling. \n The reading is the same as 垂らす.

A pretty rare occurence if you ask me. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.

4129 | 破る | やぶる | To Tear | To Rip\n To Break | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

4130 | 裏切り者 | うらぎりもの | Traitor |  | Someone who backstabs (裏切り) someone is a traitor. \n The reading is 裏切り and an exception reading for 者. Just think about how you'd think of a traitor as a "thing" (物) and not a person.

4461 | 炒る | いる | To Roast | To Toast | The kanji is fry. You already know the verb for "to fry" (炒める), so this verb is for a slightly different cooking technique — to roast.\nSo what's the difference between the two? Generally speaking, 炒める involves the use of hot fat or oil, while 炒る describes a way of cooking that involves less or no oil or fat, often to dry roast things. For example, you'd use 炒める for making fried noodles or fried rice, and 炒る for roasting sesame seeds or beans. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to use the kun'yomi reading. The tricky part is where this doesn't use the same kun'yomi as 炒める, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember this:\nNow that you know the difference between frying and roasting, we're going to roast our first dish: Eagle (い)! I heard it's your favorite food, so I just had to prepare this for you. What do you mean, "eww"?!

4465 | 伸ばす | のばす | To Stretch Something |  | If 伸びる is "to be stretched" then 伸ばす is to stretch something, where you're doing the stretching.

5002 | 筒 | つつ | Pipe | Cylinder\n Tube | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. You'll see this used to mean pipe more often than cylinder, though. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: When it comes to pipes, you always want to have two sets of two of them, just in case. So, that's a two two (つつ) set of pipes, lined up next to each other for backup.

But, this can also mean unusual or curious (as in "odd" curious, not that you're curious about something). \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou know what's unusual and rare? This maze is rare (めずら). I don't think there's a way out of it. We've been walking around for days now, and we haven't gotten any closer to the exit!
5006 | 即日 | そくじつ | Same Day |  | The instant day is the day that's going on this instant. It's the same day as now. \n The reading for 即 is the normal one. For 日 you're going to want to use the じつ reading, because, the truth (じつ) is that it's the same day today.
5007 | 封 | ふう | Seal |  | The kanji is seal in, but the vocab noun version is seal. This is simply a seal (not the water kind, the kind you use to seal something with). \n The reading is the same as one of the readings you learned: ふう. Don't be a fool, make sure you seal your envelopes.

5017 | 沼沢 | しょうたく | Swamp | Marsh | A bog swamp is a swamp or marsh. \n Oddly, this is the one word that uses the on'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. To remember this particular swamp, note how there are two kanji in here that make this area particularly swampy. Because it's the swampiest, boggiest place in all of Japan, of course the Shogun (しょう) wants it for himself. Even though it's useless land, he wants the best of everything, being the Shogun and all.
5018 | 潮 | しお | Tide | Current | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: If you think of the tide, you think of the ocean. If you think of the ocean and what it's filled with (besides water) you think of salt (しお).
5019 | 潮流 | ちょうりゅう | Tide | Tidal Current | A tides stream is the stream going through the tide. It's the tide or the tidal current. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

You should be able to read this on your own.
5021 | 威張る | いばる | To Act Big | To Be Arrogant\n To Be Bossy | Take your dignity and stretch it. Your dignity is so stretched! That makes you feel big! That's why this word is to act big or to be arrogant. \n The reading is from 威 and 張る.
5022 | 襲う | おそう | To Attack |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means attack and the verb vocab version is to attack. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: "You going to attack me or something? Oh so scary you are. Oh so scary. Ho ho ho."
5023 | 揚がる | あがる | To Be Fried Up | To Be Deep Fried\n To Be Up | This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.\nThis is an intransitive verb. The kanji means hoist, but the verb most commonly means to be fried up, ready to eat. Imagine something being hoisted up onto the table because it's fried and ready to eat. The verb can also mean, more logically, to be up. \n Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.\nLucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as 揚げる.
5024 | 慰める | なぐさめる | To Console |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means consolation and the verb vocab version is to console. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: I'm going to console you for what happened to you. The nag saw (なぐさ) was turned on and buzzed through your leg. What a nagging feeling. You need some consoling.
5025 | 滅ぼす | ほろぼす | To Destroy | To Annihilate | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means destroy and the verb vocab version is to destroy and to annihilate. \n You are going to destroy the hoe roe. This is the roe that comes from the hoe tools. If they create too much roe, they will create too many hoes. And if there are too many hoes, bad things will happen.
5026 | 群がる | むらがる | To Flock | To Crowd | Remember 群れる, which means "to flock" or "to crowd."? This also means that! \n The reading is a little different from 群れる, though. There's an extra ら in there. That being said, it's pretty similar, so you should be able to use one to remember the other after a few reps. You can also think about it this way: Everyone is flocking together in one place. Strange thing is, it's to a small 村 (むら). There's a 村 reunion going on, that's why.
5027 | 潜る | もぐる | To Go Under | To Dive Underwater\n To Go Underground\n To Pass Through | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means conceal, but as a verb, this word means to go under or to pass through. Most commonly, this word means to dive underwater or to go underground. Can you see why the kanji for conceal kind of makes sense in these cases? If you're underwater or underground, no one can see you! \n 潜る has two possible readings: もぐる and くぐる. The first is used when you mean to dive underwater or go underground.  The second is used when you pass through or under something, sometimes with difficulty, such as crawling under a fence. We want you to focus on もぐる, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhy are you trying to dive underwater again and again? It's to get mo' goo (もぐ) to sell on the black goo market. Who knew that sea goo was such a commodity?
5028 | 懲りる | こりる | To Learn By Experience |  | The kanji means chastise but the verb vocab version is to learn by experience. I guess these are kind of similar. When you make a mistake, someone will chastise you, and then you will learn by experience (either via the experience or via the chastising). \n As a child (こ) you got a lot of chastising, I bet. A lot of learning by experience (of chastising).
5029 | 刷る | する | To Print |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means printing so the verb vocab version is to print. \n When you print something out, it's usually the paperwork needed in order to sue (す) someone. You're just that kind of person, always looking to sue.
5030 | 沈む | しずむ | To Sink |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means sink so the verb vocab version is to sink.\nThis is an intransitive verb, so it refers to something sinking on its own. You didn't do anything to make it sink. You know this is when something is just sinking on its own (you didn't sink it), because of the む, which shows it's a cow sinking. The cow stepped into some quicksand and now it's sinking, not because of you. \n You look at the cow. Poor cow. She's (しず) sinking.
5031 | 裂く | さく | To Tear | To Rip Up | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means split, but if you split something, you are going to tear it or to rip up it. \n In order to get it open, you need to tear and rip up a sack (さく). Sacks don't have tabs or zippers or any of those fancy things. If you want to get at the stuff in a sack you have to tear the top right off!
5032 | 開封 | かいふう | Unsealing | Breaking A Seal\n Opening A Letter | When you open something sealed, you're unsealing it or breaking a seal.\n開封 generally refers to opening something sealed, like opening a letter or package. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
5033 | 珍〜 | ちん | Unusual | Rare\n Peculiar | Something rare is often unusual. This word could also mean rare (of course) and peculiar depending on the context.\nThese days, media often uses this word to describe the way something is unusual, quirky, and funny. \n The reading for this kanji is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. That in itself isn't too rare, wouldn't you say?
5034 | 挑戦者 | ちょうせんしゃ | A Challenger | Challenger | A challenge (挑戦) someone is someone who is going to challenge you. They are a challenger. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
5035 | 軒並み | のきなみ | Across The Board | Row Of Houses\n Altogether | Line up house counters and you'll see that all the houses you've counted are the same across the board. It also turns them into a row of houses. \n This is a combination of the words 軒 and 並 that you've already learned, so you should be able to read this word too. Just note that for 並, the み in なみ is sticking out! While you might sometimes see this written 軒並, 軒並み is way more common.
5036 | 一翼 | いちよく | A Part | A Role | One wing is just a part of the bird or plane it's attached to. But that one wing plays a role that's very important!\nThis word usually comes up in the phrase 〜の一翼を担う (to play a part in…). \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
5037 | 助力 | じょりょく | Assistance | Support | When you help with your power, you are providing assistance and support.\nNote that this is a formal word that’s mostly used in professional situations. It implies that someone has done something substantial for you. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 力 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nYou really need some assistance with this lock (りょく). You are certain that world peace and eternal happiness lie behind this one lock. But no one is willing to support you in opening it. What a cruel world.
5038 | 寝床 | ねどこ | Bed | Crib | A sleep bed is where you sleep. Where do you sleep? In a bed or a crib. Side note, if you're a baby sleeping in a crib, you must really want to learn kanji. \n This word uses the kun'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn the second kun'yomi reading for 床. You take とこ and rendaku it into どこ. How do you remember this? Just think about your bed. Then wonder, "where (どこ) is it?"
5039 | 刃 | は | Blade | Edge | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. But it also has a secondary reading you haven't learned, so here’s a mnemonic for it:\nBlade in hand, you charge at your foes hollering "Yah! Eee! Baa!" (やいば). As the blade cuts through them, you cry "Yah! Eee! Baa!" even louder. This battle cry always fuels your fury and doubles the force of your swinging blade. "Yah! Eee! Baa!"\nWhile both readings relate to blades, they have slightly different uses. は is used for any cutting tool's blade or edge, whereas やいば is a little old-fashioned and specifically refers to the blades of swords or knives, often in literary contexts.
5040 | 金髪 | きんぱつ | Blonde |  | Gold hair is blonde hair. Makes sense! \n The reading for 髪 isn't the one you learned. It's actually はつ, but it's getting rendaku'd here. So, to remember the reading of it for this word, just think about how if you were blonde, you'd wear many hats (はつ) to hide it. I have no idea why you'd hide it, but you can come up with a compelling reason that makes sense to you.
5041 | 両翼 | りょうよく | Both Wings | Both Flanks | Both wings are both wings! There are two and you have them all! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

5190 | 義塾 | ぎじゅく | Private School |  | A righteousness cram school is, for some reason, a private school.

5217 | 焦る | あせる | To Be In A Hurry | To Be Impatient\n To Be Anxious | This is a bit of a weird word. The kanji is char, and a previous word you learned (焦げる) is "to be burned." This, on the other hand, is "to be in a hurry" or "to be impatient." I guess if you're getting burned or have that feeling, you're going to be in a hurry and you're going to be impatient. You can tell that this is that word because it only has one kana, る, which stands for rude.

You're all like. Hey, I'm gonna marry you! And she's all like Tots (とつ), we gonna get, like, married! Imagine her saying more "tots" things (tots = short for totally in valley girl speak, at least in my imagination).
5226 | 磨く | みがく | To Polish | To Shine\n To Brush Your Teeth | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means polish and the verb vocab version is to polish or, strangely specifically (and we'll learn an even more specific word for this later) to brush your teeth. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
5227 | 擦る | する | To Rub | To Scrub | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

5230 | 引き裂く | ひきさく | To Tear Up | To Tear Off\n To Split | You know that 裂く is "to tear" or "to rip up." So, if you're trying to tear or rip up something, and you're pulling it at the same time, you are going to tear up that thing, or more accurately perhaps to tear off something, since you're pulling. \n The reading comes from 引く and 裂く.
5231 | 苛む | さいなむ | To Torment |  | As usual, you can guess this is a verb thanks to the う sound on the end. The kanji means frustration, and unfortunately frustration tends to torment people.
