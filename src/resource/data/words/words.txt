100001 | 一人 | ひとり | Alone | One Person | When there's one person, what are they? Well, they're either just going to be simply one person or alone. \n The reading for this vocab doesn't follow any rules you learned previously. It's an exception, which means you have to learn the reading separately too. Spend a few moments trying to remember this word, look away for 10 seconds, and then try to recall its reading. Could you do it? Try again, this time in thirty seconds. Did you do it again? Okay, go ahead and move on. You may know it now, though you'll need to recall it again in the next 5-10 minutes if you want to remember it for good.\nAlternatively, if you know the reading for the vocab word 一つ (in the same level as this word), you can know that it uses the same reading!
100002 | 大きい | おおきい | Big | Large | This is the adjective form of big. It has the same meaning, though it is a word for describing. Words that end with い are often adjectives, remember that for future words as well. So, as long as you know the meaning of this kanji, you can transfer that to the meaning of this word. It's the adjective big, or large. \n What do you do when you see something really, really big? You say おお because you can't believe your eyes. Imagine something really large and say おお out loud to help seal the memory in that brain of yours.
100003 | 八 | はち | Eight |  | When a vocab is a single kanji it usually steals its meaning from its kanji as well. Same goes for this vocab word. It means eight. \n When a vocab is a single kanji and all alone like this, it's usually going to use the kun'yomi. But, because this is a number (exception) it uses the on'yomi instead, meaning you already know the reading from when you learned the kanji!
100004 | 山 | やま | Mountain |  | A vocab made of a single kanji all alone with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) usually has the same exact meaning as the kanji it's made from. So by that you know that this vocab's meaning is mountain. \n When a vocab is a single kanji all alone with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's usually going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn when you learned the kanji. To remember this word's reading we'll use a mnemonic.\nWhat are you doing going up into the mountains? You're hunting for yams (やま). Go ahead, imagine yourself doing just that, climbing up the mountain (it's hard work!) and then digging in the ground with your hands, then pulling up that sweet, delicious yam! Mmm!
100005 | 口 | くち | Mouth |  | When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's generally going to have the same meaning as the kanji it came from. From that, you know this word's meaning is mouth. \n When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's generally going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you did not learn from learning the kanji. To remember this word, you should use a mnemonic. With your mouth, make a "kuchi kuchi kou" (くち) sound. Go ahead, make it. Focus on your mouth and try to imagine each shape it makes while zooming in on it. You're talking to a baby, which is why you're making all these ridiculous noises. Also, instead of "coo" at the end, you're saying "kou," because that's the reading of the kanji (こう).\nくちくちこう！くちくちこう！ Sounds like something from Arrested Development, actually.
100006 | ふじ山 | ふじさん | Mt Fuji | Mount Fuji\n Mt. Fuji | Just look at this word. What do you think it means? That's right - it's a name (Fuji) plus the kanji for mountain. Put those together, and you have Mount Fuji. In English the "Mount(ain)" part comes first. In Japanese, it comes at the end, sort of like the name ender さん, ちゃん, and so on. You can add 山 to the end of any mountain's name too, not just Mount Fuji. \n Normally ふじ would be in kanji, but I wanted you to see this kanji use in action since it's more useful than just being used on Mount Fuji. This is treated like a jukugo word (combo kanji word). In the case of jukugo, usually the on'yomi reading is used, meaning you just have to remember the on'yomi reading of 山. Luckily, you learned this when you were learning the kanji, so you should already know it!
100007 | 九 | きゅう | Nine |  | When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it often has the same meaning as the kanji it's based off of. Same goes for the word 九, as well. It has the same meaning as its kanji counterpart. \n When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are the exception, as you might already know. When they're alone with no okurigana they're the on'yomi reading, which you should already know from learning the kanji that makes up this word.
100008 | 一 | いち | One |  | As is the case with most vocab words that consist of a single kanji, this vocab word has the same meaning as the kanji it parallels, which is one. \n When a vocab word is all alone and has no okurigana (hiragana attached to kanji) connected to it, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, however. When a number is all alone, with no kanji or okurigana, it is going to be the on'yomi reading, which you learned with the kanji.  Just remember this exception for alone numbers and you'll be able to read future number-related vocab to come.
100009 | 一つ | ひとつ | One Thing |  | This word follows the "number of things" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means "____ things." Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for one plus つ. So, this one is one thing. \n Since all of the "number of things" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つ), you really just have to remember the part before the つ (and then remember that the つ is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).\nSo, you have one thing. What one thing do you have? You have one of He-Man's Toes, aka a single He-Toe (ひと). So what's the thing you have only one of? You have one He-Toe. Imagine He-Man walking around with one missing toe, trying to find you so he can get it back. At least you'll be able to run faster than him now.
100010 | 人 | ひと | Person |  | When a vocab is a single kanji all alone, it usually has the same meaning as its kanji parent. That goes for this vocab word as well. Person is person. \n When a vocab is a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Since you don't know the kun'yomi reading for this kanji yet, let's use a mnemonic to learn it.\nWhat does a person hate more than anything? They hate extreme heat (ひと). You can always put on more clothes to stay warm, but when the heat gets too high, you can only take off so much.
100011 | 下さい | ください | Please Give Me | Please | You know that the kanji 下 means down, and さい sounds like the word "sigh." You need to ask someone for something, so you look down, sigh, and say please give me that thing. You're ashamed that you have to ask. But you still need it. Please, please give it to me!\nYou only use this kanji version of ください when asking for something, which is why this is "please give me." If you're just saying "please," you don't need the kanji at all! \n The reading for 下 here is one you haven't learned. Just think about how it kind of sounds like you're saying please, could I (くだ) have this thing? Pretty please, could I have it?\nAlternatively, if you already knew the word ください beforehand, this shouldn't be too hard!
100012 | 七 | なな | Seven |  | When a vocab is alone with no okurigana (that's hiragana attached to a kanji) it usually has the same meaning as the kanji too. That goes for this word as well. So, if you know the kanji's meaning (seven) you'll know the vocab's meaning (seven). \n Most single-kanji all-alone vocab words like this use the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception to this rule. That being said, four and seven are exceptions to this exception to the rule (because the on'yomi readings sound too much like the word for "death"). You should learn both readings for this word, though we're going to go with なな for the main one here. You can remember that because you had seven nanas after you.
100013 | 十 | じゅう | Ten |  | When a vocab is alone like this with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it tends to steal its meaning from the kanji it came from. That means this vocab word also means ten. \n When a vocab is alone and consists of a single kanji like this, usually it uses the kun'yomi reading for the kanji. But, numbers are an exception and they use the on'yomi reading (which you learned when you learned the kanji). That means you know that this word's reading is じゅう already.
100014 | 三 | さん | Three |  | When a vocab is a single kanji and alone like this, it usually steals its meaning from the parent kanji. That goes for this word too, making the meaning of this word three. \n When a vocab is alone like this with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually uses its kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, though, and use the on'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi reading when you learned this kanji, so you already know that the reading for this vocab is さん.
100015 | 三つ | みっつ | Three Things |  | This word follows the "number of things" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means "____ things." Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for three plus つ. So, this one is three things. \n Since all of the "number of things" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つ), you really just have to remember the part before the つ (and then remember that the つ is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).\nWhat thing do you have three of? The three things that you have are actually three versions of yourself. "Who is the real one?" you ask yourself. "It's me!" "Wait, no, it's me!" Just remember that there are three of you, and they're all saying "me me me me me" to try and prove that they're the real you.
100016 | 二 | に | Two |  | When a vocab word is a single kanji without okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually has the same meaning as the kanji it's spawned from. If you know the kanji meaning you'll also know the vocab meaning. It's two! \n When a vocab word is a single kanji with no okurigana, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception to this. Numbers use the on'yomi reading, which you've already learned by learning the kanji's reading! How nice!
100017 | 二人 | ふたり | Two People | Pair\n Couple\n Two Persons | When you have two and person and then put them together, what do you get? You get a pair or two people. \n The reading for this word is quite strange. If you know 二つ's reading, you can use that to remember the 二 part (ふた). But, the り that is the 人 is a total exception, something you won't see too often (though you may have seen it in 一人). If you can use the reading of 一人 (aka if you've learned it already) then definitely use that. If not, do your best to remember the reading on your own. It's a strange one that doesn't connect to much else.
100018 | 二つ | ふたつ | Two Things |  | This word follows the "number of things" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means "____ things." Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for two plus つ. So, this one is two things. \n Since all of the "number of things" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つつつtwo things you have are 2-foot tacos (ふた). How lucky are you, that your two things are 2-foot tacos? Other people only have two foot-tacos... And trust me, you don't want to eat those.
100019 | 本 | ほん | Book |  | This vocab word is exactly the same as its parent kanji, including its meaning as well: book. It doesn't have those other meanings though, when it's just 本 alone, it's just a book. \n The reading for this word is the same as the single kanji it comes from.
100020 | 出口 | でぐち | Exit |  | The mouth you exit out of is just a doorway (I hope), but an easier way to describe this word or concept is to call it an exit. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 出口 is an exception to this rule, however, and uses its kun'yomi readings. There's no particular reason why this is, but oftentimes a "body part" word (like mouth) changes a word to use kun'yomi readings instead of on'yomi ones. You already know the kun'yomi reading for 口 (くち) from learning the vocab, but to remember the reading for 出 you can think the following:\nIf I exit out this mouth, I'll end up in the ocean (you were swallowed by a whale) and I will surely end up dead (で).\nAlso keep in mind that because of rendaku, くち becomes ぐち.
100021 | 火 | ひ | Fire |  | This vocab is made from a single kanji, which means it shares the same meaning as the parent kanji: fire. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nWhat comes off of fire? Lots and lots of heat (ひ). Feel it coming off the fire, touching and warming your face.
100022 | 五 | ご | Five |  | This vocab is made from a single kanji, which means it shares the same meaning as the parent kanji: Five. \n Since numbers are an exception, this word is read using the on'yomi reading even though it's made from a single kanji all alone. Luckily for you, you learned the reading for this word when you learned the parent kanji.
100023 | 四 | よん | Four |  | This vocab word has the same meaning as its parent kanji (single alone kanji usually do that!), meaning it means four. \n When a vocab is alone like this with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually uses its kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, though, and use the on'yomi reading. However, four and seven actually use both. We're going to go with the kun'yomi reading here, and since you haven't learned this reading yet, here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to count to four. But you're tired. One... two... three... *YAWN* ... four. There, you did it. But *yawn* now you can't stop yawning. You're so, so sleepy. Four is too high a number to count without falling asleep.\nBy the way! Both the reading よん and し are pretty common, but because the on'yomi reading し sounds just like the word for "death," it isn't used as much. Generally when you're just counting (for example, "1, 2, 3, 4..."), you will use the reading し. But when you are counting things or people, you'll use よん. There are exceptions to this, but you'll learn them as they come up.
100024 | ホテル | ホテル | Hotel |  | ホテル comes from the English word hotel and the meaning is exactly the same!\nThe only thing to watch out for is that the "l" on the end becomes ル, because that's the closest sound in Japanese.
100025 | 中 | なか | Inside | In | When the middle kanji is used as a word, it means inside. When you're in the middle of something, it means you're in that thing! \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThere's a sound coming from inside the wall. It sounds like a knock, knock, knock noise. You break down the wall, and there's some creepy dude standing inside. He is the knocker (なか).
100026 | 日本 | にほん | Japan |  | Remember the secondary meaning of 本 being "origin"? That technically makes this sun origin. Does that sound familiar? Japan is known as the "land of the rising sun", which is why this means Japan! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. The 本 is read just how you learned it, but the 日 reading is sort of an exception here, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou've finally arrived in Japan and immediately fall down on your knees (に). After two excruciatingly long flights, you've finally made it. You're here. This is Japan. Now get up off your knees, people are starting to stare.
100027 | 田 | た | Rice Paddy | Rice Field | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nJust keep in mind that compared to 田んぼ, which you learned earlier, this word is more formal and less colloquial. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When you learned the kanji that makes up this word, all you learned was the kun'yomi reading, so you should be good to go.
100028 | 六 | ろく | Six |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. Numbers, as you know, are the exception to this rule. They usually use the on'yomi reading, and the on'yomi reading is the one you learned along with this kanji, meaning you should be good to go!
100029 | 小さい | ちいさい | Small | Little | This kanji has hiragana attached and ends with an い sound. That means it's probably an adjective (and it is!). So, if you take the kanji 小 and its meaning (small), you can figure out the adjective version of it. What is the adjective version of "small?" Actually, it's the same thing: small. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the ちい portion:\nWhen you think of the word small, try to think of this cheese (ちい) store. You go inside, and all of their cheeses are so small. They hand you a magnifying glass to see all the cheeses. You look at them and exclaim: "Why are these cheeses so small???"
100030 | 日 | ひ | Sun | Day | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Take note that this word means both "sun" and "day," though. Why? because the sun takes a day to go around and come back! \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it:\nWhat do you feel from the sun? You feel the heat (ひ).
100031 | 千 | せん | Thousand |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Normally a single kanji making up a word like this means it will use the kun'yomi readings. Numbers are generally the exception, though, which means this word uses the on'yomi reading. If you learned the kanji, then you should already know this!
100032 | 水 | みず | Water |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nBe sure you always carry water when visiting the me zoo (みず). That's a zoo with rows and rows of cages of... me. And I'm thirsty!
100033 | 〜才 | さい | Years Old | Age | Although this word consists of one kanji that is all alone, it doesn't share its meaning with the parent kanji. But the meanings are similar in a way. This word means years old or age. With more years comes more talent, right? That's why this word means "years old" and not "talent," like the parent kanji.\nYou can stick this word onto numbers to say how old someone is!\nSpecial note for all of you advanced learners out there. When discussing age, 〜歳 is the original and correct kanji to use. Because 〜才 is easier to write and has the same reading, it became mainstream. You'll see it used in writing today, especially in elementary schools. In formal writing though, you'll always want to use 〜歳, which you'll learn later on. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned for the kanji, meaning you should already know it! Don't try to type the 〜 part though.
100034 | 〜円 | えん | Yen | Japanese Yen | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Be sure to omit the 〜 in your answer as it is only a placeholder for a number.
100035 | 少し | すこし | A Little | A Few\n Few | This word is a single kanji with hiragana attached, though there is no specific clue as to what type of word it is. That means you can usually guess it's a noun, adverb or na-adjective (in this case it's a noun / adverb). The meaning of this word is pretty much the same as the kanji, though, making it fairly easy. The kanji meaning for 少 is few, and the meaning of the vocab form is a little or a few. \n Did you know that this word created an English word you probably already know? Have you ever heard someone say "just a skosh"? That's 少し! Hopefully you know this English word and therefore know this Japanese word as well.
100036 | 字 | じ | Character | Kanji Character\n Letter\n Symbol | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n You only learned one reading for the kanji that makes up this word, and it's the same as the reading for this word (of course). That means you should already know the reading.
100037 | コーヒー | コーヒー | Coffee |  | コーヒー is the katakana version of the English word coffee.\nJust watch out for the second syllable, which changes to ヒー in Japanese.
100038 | お父さん | おとうさん | Father | Dad\n Papa | This word begins with an honorific (お), making whatever comes after it more elevated. Then there's 父, which you know means father. Lastly, we have the honorific name ender さん. So this is a nice way to say father. You use it when you're talking to your own dad or talking about him with friends. You can also use this when you're talking about your friends' dads.\nIn more formal settings, you'll want to use 父 (pronounced ちち) to talk about your own dad and お父様 to talk about someone else's dad. Don't worry, you'll learn that last kanji in a few lessons. Until then, it's pronounced, おとうさま. \n The part you have to learn to read is the 父 portion. This uses the kun'yomi, which you didn't learn when doing the kanji.\nImagine you are taking your venerable father to とうきょう. He's always wanted to go and this is the trip of a lifetime! Imagine walking through the streets of Tokyo with your Dad, taking in all the sights.
100039 | 父 | ちち | Father | Dad | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is the polite and humble form of father. You use this when you're talking about your own father to other people, especially if you aren't very close to them. \n The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned when learning the kanji.
100040 | 半 | はん | Half |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it's supposed to use the kun'yomi reading. But, there is no useful kun'yomi reading for this kanji, so even the single kanji vocab word version uses the on'yomi reading, which you've already learned!
100041 | こんにちは | こんにちは | Hello | Good afternoon | Connie Chihuahua (こんにちは) says hello. Connie Chihuahua is an amazing talking chihuahua. She can only say "hello", but that alone is pretty impressive.\nこんにちは is a formal way to say "hello". It’s generally used during the daytime, from late morning to early evening. Watch out for the は on the end, which is always pronounced わ.
100042 | 内 | うち | Inside | Within | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nWhen this kanji is a word on its own, it's actually very often written in hiragana. Still, the kanji version of the word is worth knowing, too! \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThere's something inside and you wanna get to what's within. Look inside. Ooh, cheese (うち)! Your favorite. Ooh cheese, how I love you.
100043 | 戸 | と | Japanese Style Door | Door | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
100044 | 母 | はは | Mother | Mom | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is the polite and humble form of mother. You use this when you're talking about your own mother to other people, especially if you aren't very close to them. \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading, but this is the reading you learned with the kanji. Just remember, your mother is a terrible person and won't stop laughing at you: "HA HA HA HA HA!"
100045 | 今 | いま | Now |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nWhat'll you drink now? I'll have a Zima, ima.\nSay "ZIMA IMA" ten times fast.
100046 | 古い | ふるい | Old | Ancient\n Out-Of-Date | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of old? It's also old, ancient, or out-of-date.\nThis word is used for things like clothes, food and friendships, but not for people! So a 古い友人 (old friend) is someone you've been friends with for a long time, not an elderly friend. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji with some hiragana attached, it's going to use the kun'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi when learning the kanji portion, so let's use a mnemonic to help you with the reading of this word:\nIf you're old, you're also full (ふる) of memories. And you're probably full of old secrets. And you're full from old people food.
100047 | 分 | ぶん | Part | Portion\n Content | This word has the same meaning that you learned with the kanji: part, or portion. By extension, it can also mean content, as in "alcohol content" because that's the portion of alcohol in a drink.\nThis word is used for fractions, too, as in one third or one quarter. Again, you can see how this links to "parts" and "portions", right? \n This word is usually combined with a word or phrase indicating whose part or portion you’re referring to. That’s probably why this single kanji vocab word uses the on’yomi instead of the kun’yomi reading. Check out the common word combinations to see what we’re talking about!\nAnd when it means part or portion, it's read ぶん. Probably because your buns come in two parts. Ohoho.
100048 | これ | これ | This One | These Ones | Collect (これ) this one right here! Go ahead, collect this one.\nYou can use これ to talk about anything that's close to you. Things that are close to you are easy to collect, after all!
100049 | 今日 | きょう | Today |  | The now day is what day? Oh, it's today. \n The reading for this word is a complete exception, though the word itself is incredibly common and useful. When you think of "today" think about what you have to do today for work.\nYou have to work in one of those mall kiosks (きょう). Just think about how sad you are that you have to do this today. What a crummy day. It's sunny outside and you're stuck in a mall manning this hermit crab kiosk.\nNote: This reading mnemonic is pretty far away from the actual reading, as far as reading mnemonics go. Use this to get yourself close, and then use your own brain grapes to get the rest of the way there. This one won't be as easy as most of the others, but do some good old fashioned memorization and you should be okay. I won't ask you to do this much, fortunately. :)
100050 | いつ | いつ | When |  | He eats (いつ) and eats and eats. When does this guy not eat?\nいつ is a question word that is used to ask when.
100051 | 広い | ひろい | Wide | Spacious | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of wide? It's also wide. \n The reading for this word is the same as the reading you learned in the kanji section: ひろ, making this ひろい.
100052 | 冬 | ふゆ | Winter |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this word is the same as the kun'yomi reading you learned for the kanji, meaning you should know both!
100053 | 早い | はやい | Early | Fast\n Quick | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of early? It's also early. \n The reading for this word is the kun'yomi reading, which you did not learn when you learned the kanji. You have to remember the はや portion to be able to read this word. In order to do that, here's a mnemonic:\nYou're fast! You're early! Your chop comes down onto your opponent's neck so quickly! As you chop him, you yell "はや!"
100054 | 花火 | はなび | Fireworks |  | The flower fire... what looks like flowers on fire? That would be fireworks. Totally makes sense, right? \n The readings for the kanji that make this word are the kun'yomi readings, where fire's ひ changes to び. You already learned the kun'yomi reading for 花 when you learned the kanji, so it's only a matter of remembering to use the kun'yomi for 火. If you do, you should be able to read this word.
100055 | 花 | はな | Flower |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. This is the reading you learned when you learned the kanji, so you're good to go. Don't forget to stop and smell the roses on the way, though.
100056 | 四つ | よっつ | Four Things |  | Any number with a つ attached is a word that means "NUMBER Things." In this case, it's four things. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can assume it uses the kun'yomi reading. The ん part of よん gets converted to a small っ though, so watch out for that.
100057 | こんばんは | こんばんは | Good Evening |  | Con ban, wah! (こんばんは) cries your friend, just as you say good evening. There's a report on the evening news about a con ban (yes, that's a ban on conning people). Wah! Exciting stuff.\nYou can use こんばんは as a greeting from around 5pm or 6pm, in both formal and informal situations.　Watch out for that は on the end, which is pronounced わ here too.
100058 | 百 | ひゃく | Hundred | One Hundred | When a vocab word is a single kanji without okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually has the same meaning as the kanji it's spawned from. If you know the kanji meaning you'll also know the vocab meaning. It's one hundred! \n When a vocab word is a single kanji with no okurigana, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception to this. Numbers use the on'yomi reading, which you've already learned by learning the kanji's reading! How nice!
100059 | 赤い | あかい | Red |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of red? Why, it's red! \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
100060 | 休み | やすみ | Rest | Break\n Vacation\n Holiday | The kanji rest has a little hiragana attached, but it's nothing that would suggest it's anything but a noun (it is!). It means the same thing as the kanji, rest. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji with some hiragana, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nSo, do you want a rest from work or school? You should say "YAASS (やす)!"
100061 | 先生 | せんせい | Teacher | Sensei | Previous life... So we're talking about someone who has a previous life, or maybe previous life experience? When you have previous life experience, you can teach others about it, making you qualified to be some kind of teacher.\n先生 is often used for school teachers, but it's also used to show respect to doctors, lawyers, authors, and other respected experts. It's used as a standalone word or a name ender like トム先生. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100062 | テレビ | テレビ | Television | TV | テレビ comes from the English word television. It’s been shortened, which is really common with loanwords in Japanese. The "vi" sound becomes ビ, too.\nテレビ is sometimes written as "TV", but even then it’s usually pronounced テレビ.
100063 | 町 | まち | Town |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou walk into this town. You hate it (because it's vocab, and who doesn't hate vocab?). So what do you do? You pull out a match (まち) and burn this town to the ground. Whoa, you some kind of psycho?
100064 | 天気 | てんき | Weather |  | What is the heaven energy? If you think about it, that's all the stuff that falls on us from the sky. Lightning, rain, snow, hail... What is all of that? It's the weather. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100065 | 白い | しろい | White |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of white? White, of course! \n This has the same reading as the vocab 白 you learned, so you already know the reading. Go you!
100066 | 年 | とし | Year | Age | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. You can also use this word to talk about someone's age. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThis year you plan on tossing (とし) out all your old stuff as a New Year's resolution. You pronounce it "toshing" though, because it has more vigor that way.
100067 | はい | はい | Yes |  | Want me to write a haiku (はい)? Yes, of course!\nはい is a formal word for "yes". You can use it to let someone know they’re right, or simply that you’re listening, as well as to respond if someone says your name.
100068 | 青い | あおい | Blue | Unripe | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of blue? It's still blue! It can also mean unripe, which might sound confusing, but it comes down to the fact that in Japanese there's some overlap between blue and green. So while in English we think of the "go" traffic light and unripe bananas as "green," in Japanese they're actually called "blue." \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the あお portion to read this word. Think of blue things on your body. Those are bruises. Touch them. What would you say? OW! (あお).
100069 | 兄弟 | きょうだい | Brothers | Siblings | You have an older brother and a younger brother. Wow! Both are here. These are brothers! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

It's close or nearby. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the ちか portion to be able to read this word. Imagine someone close to you... Too close. They are so close to you that they're touching their cheek (ちか) to your cheek. Feel the cheek on yours, it's getting awkward.
100071 | デパート | デパート | Department Store |  | デパート comes from  department store. Yet another shortened loanword! There's an extra "o" sound on the end of this one, since a word can't end in "t" in Japanese.
100072 | 毎日 | まいにち | Every Day | Daily | Every day is daily (or just every day). \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 日 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nEvery day you watch your favorite program, My Nietzsche (まいにち). It's a daily cartoon about Nietzsche and his life, which you follow religiously. Oh how much you love Nietzsche.
100073 | 多分 | たぶん | Maybe | Perhaps\n Probably | You have many parts. Look at them all. You have to choose one of the parts. You can't decide which one you want. This one? Maybe. How about this one?

100074 | 肉 | にく | Meat |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Luckily for you, this word uses the on'yomi reading that you learned even though it's a single kanji all on its own. So, you should know it already!
100075 | 来月 | らいげつ | Next Month |  | The next month is the next month! It isn't this month or the month before, it's the next one! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 月 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nNext month is when rye gets (らいげつ) into your diet! You're going to eat only rye bread and drink only rye beer for all of next month. Bet you can't wait!
100076 | いいえ | いいえ | No |  | Eeh! Eh? (いいえ) No! You’re so surprised by whatever the question was, you can only manage "Eeh! Eh? No!" in response.\nいいえ is a formal word for "no", so you can use it to answer politely in the negative.
100077 | 兄 | あに | Older Brother | Big Brother\n Elder Brother | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This implies that it is your older brother, by the way. Not somebody else's. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYour older brother is different from everyone else's. He has odd powers... some would say powers of the force. Do you know what his name is? It's Ani (あに), short for Anikin... wait a sec, does that sound familiar?
100078 | 一回 | いっかい | One Time | Once | One times is one time. How many times? Just one. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Take note that 一 is shortened (as it often is) to いっ.

100080 | 学生 | がくせい | Student |  | Who has a study life? Only one person that I know of, and that's a student. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100081 | それ | それ | That One | Those Ones | Sorry (それ), can you grab that one for me? Yeah, that, thanks!\nYou can use それ for things that are close to the person you're talking to, or fairly close to both of you.
100082 | 行き | ゆき | Train Direction | Bound For | This is a weird word. Call it exceptional. You'll see this at train stations, especially. You know the kanji means go. So, something is going somewhere. Now just use the き to help you to remember that this word means train direction (aka it tells you which direction a train is going), because this word is the key (き) to you knowing what direction you're going in so you don't get lost. You could also remember this word as "bound for" aka "Bound for Tokyo Station." \n The reading is also an exception. It can be いき, but instead we're focusing on the ゆき reading. You have to remember the ゆ portion, so think of it this way:\nJust think about the train direction that you (ゆ) need to go in. It's all about you. Not your friends or anyone else. You. You are the most important person at this train station.
100083 | 大学 | だいがく | University | College\n Uni | What's the big study? If I had to choose, I'd probably say this is college or university. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 大 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:\nYour university is best known for its dye gawking (だいがく). It's a sport in which you gawk at dye, and your university is the best at it! Other universities might be known for their football or basketball teams, but yours is the best at dye gawking.
100084 | 色々 | いろいろ | Various |  | This is the kanji color repeated twice (the 々 character just repeats the kanji before it). When you have colors and colors and colors, you have a lot of variety. That's why this word means various. \n The reading for this kanji is just the kun'yomi reading twice. Since you've learned the kun'yomi reading already, you should be able to read this word as well. Nothing tricky about it.
100085 | 弟 | おとうと | Younger Brother | Little Brother | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou look at your younger brother. He's a scheming one. He's smiling up at you. Why? Because he's lit a firecracker on your foot. It explodes, sending your toe flying. You yell "OH. Toe? TOE!" (おとうと) as you realize what's going on.
100086 | 明るい | あかるい | Bright | Cheerful | This is a single kanji plus the hiragana るい. Words that end in い are usually adjectives, and this is no exception. What's the adjective form of bright? It's also bright. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have to remember the あか portion. What is あか in Japanese? It is "red." So, think of something that's really bright. Now, imagine it being totally red (aka あか). In Japan, the color red is associated with the sun, and the sun is pretty bright. If you can remember this you can also remember the reading of this word.
100087 | 安い | やすい | Cheap | Inexpensive | This is a single kanji with an い at the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. One of the meanings of 安 is cheap, so this is just that as an adjective, cheap. Time to go to a 100円 shop and get some 安い goods, ammiright? \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\n"Would you like this item for cheap?"\n"YAASS (やす), please!"
100088 | 中国 | ちゅうごく | China |  | The middle country... who could that be? Let's think about it. Who invented kanji and therefore probably thinks they're the middle of the world? Who also is just a huge country that ruled much of Asia? That would be none other than China. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just make sure you watch out for the rendaku.
100089 | 有名 | ゆうめい | Famous |  | When you have a name (that is known to people) or you have famousness, you are probably someone who is famous. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100090 | 家 | いえ | House | Home | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji. But there's a second reading you haven't learned yet, so here's a mnemonic for both:\nWhat do you do in your house? You eat eggs (いえ). You love to eat eggs at home. But it has to be on the 内 (うち), a.k.a. the inside, of your house. For some reason you can only eat eggs in the 内 of your house.\nBoth readings relate to house and home, but いえ is a bit more for the physical building (the house) while うち is more for your personal sense of home, including your family and household.
100091 | 私 | わたし | I | Me | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n If you're lucky, you already know this (very) common word's reading. It's the word for "I," probably one of the first things you'd learn in Japanese. The reading for this is わたし. If you don't know that already, just think: "What, a し?" referring to the reading of the kanji, which is し.
100092 | 長い | ながい | Long |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of long? It's also long. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou have something that's really long. It's this crazy hair growing out of the tip of your nose. You don't really care either way if it stays or goes, but you're too lazy to cut it off. Your parents, though, keep trying to nag (なが) you to trim it. Imagine this process happening and be irritated about it. What naggers.
100093 | 地図 | ちず | Map |  | The diagram of the earth. What could that be other than a map? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100094 | 姉 | あね | Older Sister | Big Sister\n Elder Sister | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is your older sister, by the way. Not somebody else's. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet,  so here's a mnemonic to help you remember:\nPicture your older sister (even if you don't have one), her birthday is coming up and there's only one thing she wants from you. A necklace (あね). She's wanted a necklace for years and you're finally going to give her one. She'll be so happy.
100095 | お姉さん | おねえさん | Older Sister | Miss | The お makes the word more polite. You're elevating the "older sister" title because you're a good younger sibling. Otherwise, the meaning of this word is the same as the kanji - just the feeling is different. You can also use this word to refer to a youthful-looking woman that you don't know, as in "Excuse me miss!" \n The reading is different too. It has some hiragana attached to it, which is a clue that this uses a kun'yomi reading. Let's use a mnemonic to learn that reading.\nImagine your older sister (even if you don't have one). She is, for some reason, a horse. Imagine petting her, giving her carrots, and doing other horse-related things with her. What do horses say? They say nehhhh (ねえ).
100096 | 店 | みせ | Shop | Store | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nThink of your favorite shop. Okay, now imagine yourself going to it. When you arrive, the entire shop is totally missing (みせ). Feel the shock and awe of this. It's as if it picked up and left overnight. No building, no anything. Just missing.
100097 | タクシー | タクシー | Taxi | Cab | タクシー is the katakana version of the English word taxi. The "xi" sound becomes クシー to fit better with Japanese pronunciation.
100098 | お茶 | おちゃ | Tea |  | The お just makes the word more polite. Since tea is so important in Japan, it gets the お. Otherwise, you should be able to figure out the meaning as it's the same as the kanji. \n The reading is the on'yomi reading, just like you learned with the kanji.
100099 | あれ | あれ | That One Over There | Those Ones Over There | You need a lens (あれ)? How about that one over there? You’re in a camera shop picking out a new lens, and that one over there looks good.\nUse あれ to refer to something that's far from both you and the person you're talking to.
100100 | この | この | This | These | Remember how これ means "this one"? Well, この simply means this. The difference is that これ is used on its own, whereas この goes before a noun. For example, この人 means "this person".\nNotice how words like this starting with こ are close to you? We'll be learning a few more of these, and they all follow the same pattern!
100101 | 東京 | とうきょう | Tokyo | Toukyou | The East Capital in Japan is Tokyo. If you look on a map and compare it to 京都 (Kyoto, the other capital in history), you'll see it's East of Kyoto, making it the East Capital, Tokyo. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100102 | 地下 | ちか | Underground | Basement\n Cellar | Below the ground is underground. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100103 | どの | どの | Which |  | Remember how どれ means "which one"? どの has a very similar meaning: which. Whereas どれ is used on its own, どの is used before a noun to ask "which" out of three or more options. So for example, どの本 is "which book (out of that pile)?".\nNotice how question words often start with a ど? We'll be seeing more of these!
100104 | 黒い | くろい | Black |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of black? It's also black. Special Note: The noun version of black also exists in Japanese. It is just 黒 with the same pronunciation, but minus the い which makes it adjective-tastic. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nThink of black things. One very common black thing is the common crow (くろ). Associate those two together.
100105 | 映画 | えいが | Movie | Film | It's a reflection of an image on a screen, and the image is moving! What is this? It's a movie. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100106 | 近く | ちかく | Near | Neighborhood\n Vicinity\n Nearly\n Shortly | This is the noun version of the kanji near. So it also means near, or in the neighborhood of something. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading when you learned 近い, so you should be able to read this word as well.
100107 | 来週 | らいしゅう | Next Week |  | The next week is the next week. It isn't last week or this week, it's the next one! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100108 | 〜時 | じ | O'Clock |  | If there's a number before 時, it means o'clock. For example １時 is 1:00, and ２３時 is 23:00 or 11pm. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
100109 | お兄さん | おにいさん | Older Brother | Guy | This word starts with an お to make it more polite. Then it has the kanji 兄 which you already know. Lastly, it has さん which is an honorific to elevate people and be polite. This is basically the formal way of saying older brother (versus plain old 兄). It can also be used to refer to a guy that you don't know who has a youthful appearance. \n The reading for this one is pretty tricky, and I'd consider it an exception. To remember it, you have to learn the 兄 part, and everything else will fall into place. Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYour (kind) older brother pushes you down on the ground. You stand up and look at your knee (にい), which is all bloody. "Why'd you do that to my knee!?" you ask. "You're supposed to be a nice older brother, that's why I call you お兄さん!"
100110 | 本当に | ほんとうに | Really | Truly | 本当 is reality or truth (level 5 vocab). If you add on に, this changes the word to an adverb, and we get really or truly. 本当に! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It shares the reading with the level 5 本当 as well, but just has a particle on the end. Really!
100111 | 学校 | がっこう | School |  | A study school is obviously a place where people study and learn. In English, that's simply a school. \n This jukugo word consists of on'yomi readings, except 学 (がく) is shortened with a small っ to make it がっこう.
100112 | 雪 | ゆき | Snow |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading you learned with the kanji is the same as the reading for this vocab word. Enjoy the snow!
100113 | 夏 | なつ | Summer |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading you learned with the kanji is the same as the reading for the vocab.
100114 | 高い | たかい | Tall | High\n Expensive | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of tall or expensive? It's the same: tall or expensive.\nWeird that this word means both of these things, yeah? Just imagine money piled up to be really tall. That money is tall because it needs to buy something expensive. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nBeing tall is really expensive because you have to buy a tall car (たか). If it's not a tall car then your tall body won't fit inside, and those tall cars are expensive!
100115 | その | その | That | Those | Remember how それ means "that one"? その has a very similar meaning: that. It's used before a noun that's either close to the person you're talking to, or fairly close to both of you. For example, その本 is "that book", and the book in question might be in the hand of the person you're talking to, or it might be on a shelf not far from you both.
100116 | あの | あの | That Over There | Those Over There | Remember how あれ means "that one over there"? Well, あの means that, and goes before a noun to point out something that is far away from both you and the person you're talking to, such as あの本 (that book over there) or あの子犬 (that puppy over there).\nNotice how these words starting with あ are far away from you? We'll be learning a few more of these, and they all follow the same pattern! What's more, you’ll notice that words ending in の tend to go before a noun.
100117 | 今週 | こんしゅう | This Week |  | The now week is this week. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100118 | 時 | とき | Time | Hour | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nWhat time is it? It's time to key (とき) your enemy's car. Imagine yourself looking at your watch, waiting until the correct time to perform a synchronized keying of someone's car. Who do you hate the most? Whose car would you like to key?
100119 | 大学生 | だいがくせい | University Student | College Student\n Uni Student | You know that 学生 means "student" and you know that 大学 means university/college. Combine the two and you have a university student / college student. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100120 | 週末 | しゅうまつ | Weekend |  | The end of the week is the weekend... that is, unless you work on the weekend, but we can't cater to everyone here. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100121 | 何時 | なんじ | What Time |  | This is a good word to know to ask for the time. What is the time? This is how you ask what time it is. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100122 | 朝ごはん | あさごはん | Breakfast |  | ごはん is a food or meal (maybe you'll learn the kanji for it later, but it's not usually used, so you're learning it this way now). What is your morning meal? That is breakfast (not to be confused with second breakfast, you hobbit). \n The reading for 朝 is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, meaning you should be able to read everything here.
100123 | 医者 | いしゃ | Doctor | Physician | Someone who works in medicine is a doctor. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100124 | 毎朝 | まいあさ | Every Morning |  | Every morning is every morning! \n The reading is a combination of on'yomi and kun'yomi. That being said, both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this.
100125 | 楽しい | たのしい | Fun |  | Ending with an い tells you that this word is an い-adjective. What's the adjective form of pleasure? Well, you could say it's "pleasurable," but I'm afraid that's not what we're going for here. In this case, this word is a little more innocent. It just means fun. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nHow much fun did you have? You just had a ton o' (たの) fun!
100126 | ここ | ここ | Here |  | Remember how words beginning with こ are close to you? It ends with こ too, which is a clue that we’re talking about a place. So ここ means here.
100127 | 〜道 | どう | Method Of | Way\n Style\n Way Of | This is a word that's attached to the end of various other words. Think of a "road" as a way or method of something. For example, the どう in Judo is the soft "way." There are many words that end with 道, and you'll see them later on. For now, know that this means method of or way. \n This word is added to the end of many different words, meaning it's treated like most jukugo (and uses an on'yomi reading). You know the on'yomi reading, so you should be able to read this word. Be sure to drop the 〜 when writing in the reading in the test, though. It's only there to show that it's added onto things and not part of the correct answer.
100128 | 音楽 | おんがく | Music |  | What is the sound of pleasure? What sound puts you at ease? For most people that is some nice music. Just be sure you don't put on any Bieber... that would be like 不音楽 or something... I kid, I kid. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 楽 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nIf you play your music too loud, people will come and gawk (がく) at you. But if you try to turn it off and say, "OH I DON'T LIKE MUSIC ANYWAY!" they'll gawk at you even more. Learn proper music etiquette and people won't gawk at you so much, okay?
100129 | 絵 | え | Picture | Painting\n Drawing\n Illustration | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n絵 refers to pictures, such as paintings, drawings, or illustrations. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
100130 | 所 | ところ | Place | Spot\n Scene | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nWondering about how 所 differs from 場所? While 場所 only refers to a physical location, 所 can also refer to an abstract place, such as a point in time, a situation, or a condition. Hence, 所 usually needs some context to clarify what kind of place you are talking about. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nHere's the place! Either you have to talk or row (ところ). If you talk, maybe you can talk your way out of this problem you're in. If you row, you may be able to escape. Either way, this is the place for it.
100131 | まだ | まだ | Still | Not Yet | You've been getting madder (まだ) and madder, and you’re still mad. You’re not yet as mad as you could be, though.\nYou can use まだ to talk about a situation that started in the past and continues into the present. Wait! Where are you going? I'm still explaining this! I'm not done yet!
100132 | 電話 | でんわ | Telephone | Phone | An electricity talk. What is this witchcraft? The only way to talk via electricity is with a telephone. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100133 | 時間 | じかん | Time |  | The time interval of time is just the time. As is often the case, if two similar meaning kanji are combined into one word, they tend to produce a word with a similar meaning. Excuse me, friend, what's the 時間? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100134 | 明日 | あした | Tomorrow |  | A bright day isn't today (because today was terrible), it's tomorrow, because you can always look to tomorrow to be a better, brighter day. \n The reading makes no sense at all. You have to learn it straight up, and can't rely on the kanji it's made from. Why is tomorrow going to be such a bright and awesome day? Because you're making ash tacos for dinner, and that's your favorite. Imagine imagining tomorrow, full of ash tacos and deliciousness. Maybe you could use some of those Dorito taco shells?\nA note about the other two readings あす and みょうにち: あす is used in the news and in weather reports, and みょうにち is really only used in business, so you should really only be using あした for now. But it's good to know that the other two readings exist!
100135 | 電車 | でんしゃ | Train |  | You would think that an electricity car was an electric car, but this word was made before the days of the Prius. This refers to a train, which I guess was electric at some point. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100136 | どこ | どこ | Where |  | Remember how words beginning with ど are often question words, and words ending in こ refer to places? This one's no exception, so どこ means where.
100137 | 服 | ふく | Clothes | Clothing | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the reading you learned with the kanji and uses the on'yomi even though it's a single word. Very strange, but convenient for you so long as you remember this exception reading word.
100138 | 火事 | かじ | Fire |  | A fire matter is a fire, as in the destructive burning of something. There's a fire! Run, run away!\n火事 is often used for when houses or other buildings are on fire. If you hear someone shout 火事だ, it's probably time to get out of wherever you are. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100139 | 家事 | かじ | Housework | Chores | You know 事 means "occurrence," but it also means "matter." So you can think of a house matter as  as housework or chores. Housework and chores are really just house matters that you have to deal with, after all. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading of 家 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nHousework done in a car (か) is still housework. Think of all the times you've tidied up your car. That's housework too!
100140 | 空手 | からて | Karate |  | What can you do with empty hands? Karate, that's what. Karate is practiced without weapons, so with empty hands! \n This word uses the kun'yomi of both kanji, and you haven't learned this kun'yomi for 空 yet. As long as you know the meaning, the reading should be easy, but here's a mnemonic to help you just in case:\nKarate comes from (から) Japan!
100141 | 新しい | あたらしい | New |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of new? It's new. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYour family buys you a new Atari! You're so excited! But wait... what's this? This is no Atari. This is an Atara... a knockoff video game system :(
100142 | 海 | うみ | Ocean | Sea | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nYou visit the sea. Strangely, it asks you who is visiting. You're so full of yourself (even in front of the sea/ocean) that you reply: "um, me?" (うみ). Imagine yourself feeling this full of yourself.
100143 | 出身 | しゅっしん | One's Origin | One's Hometown\n One's Birthplace | The exit that somebody starts from is one's origin, one's hometown, or one's birthplace. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Just watch out for the つ of 出, which becomes っ.
100144 | あそこ | あそこ | Over There |  | Remember how words beginning with あ show that whatever you're talking about is far away from both you and the person you're talking to? And how words ending in こ refer to places? So what do you think this means? That right, it's over there.\nJust watch out for the extra そ in this word. If you need help remembering this, imagine a sock oh (あそこ) so far over there. It's lucky that it's so far over there, because that sock stinks. You can still smell it, even though it's all the way over there in the distance.
100145 | そこ | そこ | There |  | Remember how words beginning with そ are either close to the person you're talking to, or fairly close to both of you? And how words ending in こ refer to places? This one's no exception. そこ means there.
100146 | パン | パン | Bread |  | パン is the katakana version of the Portuguese word "pão" and means bread in English.\nIf you know the Portuguese, Spanish, or French word for bread, you shouldn't have trouble remembering this word. If not, here's a mnemonic to help you:\nYou use a pan (パン) to make all your bread. It's your special bread pan, and all the bread you make with it is delicious.
100147 | 速い | はやい | Fast |  | Just like the meaning of the kanji (fast) this adjective also means fast. \n Remember how 早い means "early"? If you are early to something, it probably means you moved fast to get there. These two words share a reading (and have similar meanings, in a way, as well!).
100148 | 病院 | びょういん | Hospital |  | A sick institution is a place where sick people go. That is a hospital. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100149 | 日本語 | にほんご | Japanese Language | Japanese | You know 日本 is "Japan." So, when you add language onto the end of that you have Japanese language. \n The reading is just the vocab word 日本 (にほん) plus the on'yomi that you learned for 語. Combine them together to get the reading for this word.
100150 | 終点 | しゅうてん | Last Stop | Final Stop\n Terminus | The end point is where everything ends... but for this example, think of a map with a route on it. The last spot on the route is the "last point." It is the last stop. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100151 | 線 | せん | Line |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This also works for "train lines" as well. You'll see this attached onto the ends of names describing them. \n The reading you learned with the kanji is the same for this vocab word. Enjoy it!
100152 | 新聞 | しんぶん | Newspaper |  | The new hear is what it sounds like. It's new things that you're hearing about in your ear... at least that's what it was back a long time ago. Now those new things that get to your ear get to you via other mediums. In this case, a newspaper. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100153 | 次 | つぎ | Next |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:\nSomeone yells out "NEXT!" because the first thing didn't work on you. That was a single guillotine. Now they are going to try two guillotines (つぎ) and see how that works on your thick neck. NEXXXXT!
100154 | 地下鉄 | ちかてつ | Subway | The Underground\n The Tube\n The Metro | The ground below iron is iron under the ground. It isn't a deposit of iron, though. It's man-made. And what's made of iron? Trains. In this case, because it's underground, it's a subway. Depending on where you live, you might call it the Underground, the Tube, or the Metro \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100155 | とても | とても | Very |  | Look at this totem, oh (とても)! It's very, very, very, very lucky, as all totems should be.\nThis word has a slightly formal feel to it, and you’ll come across it most in writing.
100156 | 便利 | べんり | Convenient | Handy\n Useful | When you profit from your convenience, that means you have something very convenient or handy. Remember, you can profit in other ways besides money. This convenience could be giving you a profit in happiness or extra time as well. All these things are very handy to have. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100157 | 仕事 | しごと | Job | Work\n Occupation | You know 事 means "occurrence," but it can also mean "thing." So when you're doing things all day, what are you probably doing? A job! All jobs really just amount to doing things. \n This word uses the on'yomi reading for 仕 and the kun'yomi reading for 事. Please note that 事 uses the reading こと, which you didn't learn with the kanji, but you have come across it once or twice by now, and because of the way rendaku works, it's changed to the voiced ごと.
100158 | 仲 | なか | Relationship | Relation | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the kun'yomi reading since it's a single kanji, all alone, but this is the reading you learned with the kanji, so you should be okay and have a great relationship with this word going forward.
100159 | 神社 | じんじゃ | Shinto Shrine |  | A God company... think of this as "what 'company' does the god's work?" Well, the answer to that is a shrine, probably. In this case a Shinto Shrine because of the しん in the 神. \n But wait! 神 is read じん in this word for some reason. Darn them gods, always messing around, adding dakuten. Maybe this will help, though: Imagine yourself at a Shinto Shrine. You are praying to the Gods, asking for food. Out from the sky rains Ginger (じんじゃ). You are pelted with it and not sure if you should be happy or upset.
100160 | 買い物 | かいもの | Shopping |  | You've hopefully seen 買う by now and know it means "to buy." So, 買い is going to be similar to that. Add that to thing and you have a "buying things" sort of word. What does "buying things" describe? It describes shopping. \n The readings are the kun'yomi, which is usually the case when there's hiragana in the middle. You learned the reading for 買い when you learned the kanji, as well as the word 買う, and you learned this reading of 物 in the word 物!
100161 | 時々 | ときどき | Sometimes | At Times | You know the single word 時, right? It means time. This is that twice. So you have one time, and you have another time. They are separate. Things don't happen in every of these times you have. They happen sometimes. \n The reading is the vocab word 時 twice, with the second one getting rendaku'd.
100162 | 誰 | だれ | Who |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
100163 | 空港 | くうこう | Airport |  | Put aside your steampunk blimp fantasies for a moment. A sky harbor is an airport, nothing more. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100164 | 野球 | やきゅう | Baseball |  | Field Sphere! The greatest sport to grace this earth since a very similar (aka the same) sport, baseball.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100165 | 都市 | とし | City | Municipality | A metropolis city is a city. When you're referring to just a plain ol' city, sans name, you can use this word. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100166 | 寒い | さむい | Cold |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of cold? It's cold.\n寒い is used specifically for when you feel cold. You can say it when you're outside on a chilly winter day, for example, or when you walk into a cold room. It can even be used as a response to unfunny jokes that leave you cold. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading which you learned with the kanji (Samurai (さむ)). Remember?
100167 | 会社員 | かいしゃいん | Company Employee | Office Worker | A "company" (会社) member is someone who works at a company. This is a company employee. There are many of these in Japan. Most of them are drunk. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100168 | 家族 | かぞく | Family | Immediate Family | Your house tribe is your family. They live in the same house as you and they're part of your "tribe." This is closer than family, though (depending on how you look at family). This is your immediate family because these are the people you live with and give birth to, etc. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100169 | 一階 | いっかい | First Floor | Floor One\n Ground Floor\n First Story | The one floor is the first floor (or floor one). In Japan, that means the ground floor. Pretty simple. \n The reading is on'yomi because it's a jukugo kanji. Be careful of the 一 though. It gets shortened and has a little っ in there.
100170 | 温泉 | おんせん | Hot Springs | Onsen | A warm spring (like the water kind of spring) is a hot spring. These are really nice. You should go to them in Japan. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100171 | 暑い | あつい | Hot Weather | Hot | This is the adjective form of hot... but we're going to call it hot weather. Why? Because there's a difference between something that's hot and the weather or atmosphere being hot. This is that kind of hot, as in..."Damn, man, it's hot out here!" \n This uses the same reading as the one you learned with the kanji, so you're good to go here!
100172 | 京都 | きょうと | Kyoto | Kyouto | The capital metropolis back in the day was Kyoto. Now of course the capital is Tokyo, but kanji doesn't know this. That's why Kyoto is the capital metropolis! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100173 | 二階 | にかい | Second Floor | Floor Two\n Second Story | The two floor is the second floor. In Japan, that means the floor above the ground floor. Going up! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100174 | 息子 | むすこ | Son |  | The breath child (that lets you release your breath when it's born) is a son. Nowadays it's cool to have a girl, but back in the day you wanted a son to carry on your underwater basket weaving legacy. That's why this is a son. \n The reading of this is messed up. 子 is こ, that should be okay. 息 is むす for some reason though. Why? Because you gave birth to a son, but he was a moose (むす). You better hold that breath again, because this is not what you wanted.
100175 | 旅行 | りょこう | Trip | Travel | When you go on a trip you're taking a trip. This is travel. You should try to do this occasionally! Perhaps a nice 旅行 to Japan? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100176 | 温かい | あたたかい | Warm |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of warm? It's warm. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nTouch something that's warm... too warm! You pull your hand back and go "AH ta-ta! (あたた). People make this noise when they touch something that's hot, I hear. It's almost like saying "hot hot hot" while dropping the "h" sound.\nPeople often pronounce this as あったかい, especially in casual, spoken Japanese. The "correct" reading is still あたたかい though, so keep that in mind when you're trying to type the kanji or taking an important test!
100177 | 彼氏 | かれし | Boyfriend |  | A he mister is not just he, it's "mister he," and mister he is your he, your boyfriend. \n The readings are the ones you learned with the kanji.
100178 | 宿題 | しゅくだい | Homework |  | The lodge you're staying in has a topic around it. Think of it as a theme. This theme is doing your homework. So yeah, you just went to a nice lodge for vacation only to have to do homework everywhere. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100179 | 熱い | あつい | Hot Thing | Hot | This is for when a thing is hot, making this word hot thing. When the weather is hot that's 暑い. This is when you touch something and you burn yourself. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: This has the same reading as 暑い, so if you've learned that you'll know how to read this word as well. If you haven't run into that word, you've probably run into the kanji 暑 at least. That uses the reading あつ. Two similar concepts, but there are two kanji to differentiate, which gets confusing.
100180 | 彼女 | かのじょ | She | Girlfriend | A he woman is she. Also could mean girlfriend, depending on how it's used. \n The reading for this is a bit weird, at least for the 彼 portion. Just think about how she (your girlfriend) is a canoe (かの), and you love that canoe girlfriend more than anything. She is your best friend and your lover, and everyone thinks you're weird. Imagine everyone thinking you're weird as you give kisses to your canoe girlfriend.
100181 | 駅 | えき | Station | Train Station | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Usually this refers to a train station in particular, but can be any kind of station. \n The kanji here uses えき as both its on'yomi and kun'yomi, so no worries here. You can go to this station or that station, and both stations will use the same reading as the kanji it comes from.
100182 | 料理 | りょうり | Cooking | Cuisine\n Dish | There is a reason for this fee that you have to pay to get in here. We are cooking cuisine for you to eat while you're watching the show. If we weren't cooking a dish for you, we probably wouldn't charge you this fee! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100183 | お願いします | おねがいします | Please Help Me | Please\n If You Would Be So Kind | This is a tricky word that doesn't really have a good translation. The best ways I've seen it done in terms of getting a meaning across are please and please help me. When you say this word you're kind of saying "please help me out and I'm relying on you and you're kind of awesome too." Anyways, please is a pretty good way to do it. So, when you see this word you'll notice it has the request kanji in it. You can guess you're requesting something. What is that thing? It's help (please help me) and you're asking very nicely too (please). \n You ask for help by saying please help me, and that person does try to help you... but the amount they do for you is so negligible that it hardly does anything to help you at all. Please try to help me again, this time better?
100184 | 秋 | あき | Autumn | Fall | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, あき.
100185 | 晴れ | はれ | Clear Weather | Sunny | If you say something is going to clear up, you're usually talking about the weather. That makes this clear weather or sunny.\nMaybe because of those connotations, 晴れ can also be used to describe special occasions that are usually public. For example, a wedding or a big recital might be called a 晴れの場 (special occasion). Similarly, the special clothing you wear to such events is called 晴れ着 (formal attire). \n This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
100186 | 英語 | えいご | English Language | English | The English language is the language you're reading right here and now. This is the English language. It is English. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100187 | 毎晩 | まいばん | Every Night | Nightly | Every night is simply every night. What do you do every night? \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100188 | 今晩は | こんばんは | Good Evening |  | This word is made of now and night with the hiragana は at the end. The は here is pronounced as わ (the old pronunciation). When you say "now night!" you're really saying good evening.\nJust keep in mind that writing 今晩は is pretty old school. These days it's almost always written as こんばんは. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just be aware that the は at the end is actually the particle は so it's pronounced like わ.
100189 | 夫 | おっと | Husband |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Think about your husband even if you don't have one. What's his name? It's Otto (おっと), and he's always leaving you at home because he's working at the auto (おっと) shop.
100190 | ご飯 | ごはん | Meal | Cooked Rice | The ご just makes this word more polite and fancy. When it comes to food, it's nice to be those things. This has the same meaning as the kanji (meal) making it meal, but it also refers to cooked rice as well. So, "Come eat your ご飯" can be both "come eat your rice" and "come eat your meal." Really, since most Japanese meals come with rice, though, you can see how the overlap happens. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Now how about you "hand" me another bowl of rice?
100191 | 春 | はる | Spring |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Ah, the beauty of spring! Err... はる, I mean.
100192 | 美味しい | おいしい | Tasty | Delicious | Something with a beauty taste is something that is really tasty or delicious. Mmmm, yum!\nWhile 美味しい mostly describes tasty food, you may also occasionally see it being used for a sweet deal or situation that benefits you. \n The reading for this makes no sense at all. You'll have to learn it straight up, that is, unless you know the word おいしい already, which many people do as it's used in every other sentence in every Japanese variety show. If you don't know this word already, just think of yourself eating something delicious. It's so delicious it makes you mad, I have no idea why. You yell at the chef: "OI (おい). OI! WHY IS THIS SO DELICIOUS????"
100193 | 弁当 | べんとう | Bento | Box Lunch | You know how 弁 means dialect and 当 means success? Well, this isn't going to help you much, because this means bento or box lunch. Chances are, though, you know the word "bento" from English. So, if you read this word (which you should be able to) you can figure out it's べんとう. If you do that, you can realize this word means bento too! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100194 | 危ない | あぶない | Dangerous | Risky | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of dangerous? It's dangerous. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Someone is in danger! It's poor old abe (あぶ) Lincoln. You try to save him, yelling out 危ないよ！！！！, but he gets shot in the back of the head anyways.
100195 | 遠い | とおい | Far | Far Away | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of far? It's also far (or it's far away). \n You want to go far, far away when you see a toe... oh (とお)! You realize there is a zombie toe on the ground and it reminds you of where you can go that's far from here—where the zombie that once had this toe went! (Remember the kanji mnemonic? It's that scooter zombie's toe that makes you say oh and want to go.)
100196 | 面白い | おもしろい | Interesting | Amusing\n Funny | The face of this object is so white! Why is it so white compared to everything else? This is so interesting... \n The reading is unlike what you've learned before, at least with the 面 part (白い is just like the vocab word 白い). When you look at the white face of the object you say to your friend Moe: "Oh mo!" (おも) because you want him to come over and look at this. Try to imagine someone you know named Moe, or at least a celebrity or something named Moe.
100197 | 美術館 | びじゅつかん | Museum | Art Museum\n Art Gallery | You know 美術 is fine art. So what is a public building that contains said fine art?

100199 | 公園 | こうえん | Public Park | Park | A public park is a park that is public. It's a public park. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100200 | 動物園 | どうぶつえん | Zoo | Zoological Gardens\n Menagerie | Remember how 動物 means animal? Well when you add park it becomes a zoo. It's a park for animals. Except the animals can't leave. Ever. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100201 | 底 | そこ | Bottom |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n This vocab uses the same reading as the one you learned with the kanji. Well played!
100202 | 朝ご飯 | あさごはん | Breakfast |  | The morning meal is the meal you eat in the morning. That is breakfast. \n The readings are the ones you learned with the kanji. It's also like the vocab: 朝 is like the vocab version, あさ and ご飯 is like the word you learned, ごはん.
100203 | 晩ご飯 | ばんごはん | Dinner | Supper | The night meal is the meal you eat at night. That is dinner. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100204 | 恋愛 | れんあい | Love | Romance | When you have romance and love all in the same package. Well, that is love! Ah, love! This is the word used when talking about love, though.

100205 | 昼ご飯 | ひるごはん | Lunch |  | The noon meal is the meal you eat at noon. What meal is that? It's delicious, delicious lunch. \n The readings come from the words 昼 and ご飯. If you know how to read those words you can read this word as well.
100206 | 薬 | くすり | Medicine | Drug\n Drugs | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. If you're looking for medicine in Japan, look for this sign. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You need some medicine, stat! But, nobody wants to give you any medicine. You keep asking your pharmacist, Yuri, if he'll give you some medicine. He says no. You get pissed off, and you cuss yuri (くすり) out. He gives you the medicine after you cuss him out.
100207 | 鼻 | はな | Nose |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the kanji. Smells nice, right?
100208 | 警察 | けいさつ | Police |  | They warn you and they guess when you've done something wrong (with evidence, of course!). They are the police. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

100210 | 飴 | あめ | Candy | Hard Candy\n Lollipop | The kanji and the word are exactly the same.

You learned this reading with the kanji, so you should be able to read it already!
100211 | 可愛い | かわいい | Cute |  | It's possible to love this thing. It's so gosh darn cute! Any really cute thing is possible to love. \n The reading for this word is screwed up, though if we're lucky, you already know the word for cute. It seems to have injected itself into American and English culture a decent amount, anyways. If you are one of the lucky ones, you'll know that this word is read as かわいい. If you're not, think of the cute thing being a cow. Then you say, "that cowはいい" (かわいい), or "that cow is good" because it's so cute.
100212 | 金曜日 | きんようび | Friday |  | This is a day of the week. You know this because it has 曜日 in it. But what day of the week is it? The gold day of the week is the greatest day.

This is the most common way to say "friend," so learn it if you want to make any! \n The readings for both of these are readings you haven't learned yet, though maybe you already know this word since it's fairly common. Think of it this way. You have your friend Tom (とも) Cruise. You like him, and he likes you. You're close enough friends that you can touch (だち) each other too. Like, on the shoulder or on the hand or whatever, without it being awkward. So, you like to Tom touch (ともだち) when you can, because he has nice skin.
100214 | 静か | しずか | Quiet |  | This is the な adjective form of quiet, which is kind of just like the noun, anyways. What is the adjective version of quiet? It's also quiet. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You need to be quiet. She's (しず) being nice and quiet, unlike you!
100215 | 大丈夫 | だいじょうぶ | Safe | All Right\n Okay | The big height of your husband makes everything safe and all right. Nothing you need to worry about when you have your super giant husband around to protect you. This is a really useful word, and it is used all the time. If someone asks: "Are you alright?" you could say in response "大丈夫" to mean you're doing all right. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Watch out for the rendaku.
100216 | 土曜日 | どようび | Saturday |  | This is a day of the week. You know this because it has 曜日 in it. But what day of the week is it? The earth day of the week is a day you find yourself close to the earth. Either you found you drank too much on Friday, so on this day's morning you're laying right on the ground of earth. Or, maybe you just want to sleep in after staying up late on Friday. Either way, this day you lay close to the earth is Saturday. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know the word 曜日 as well.
100217 | 日曜日 | にちようび | Sunday |  | This is a day of the week. You know this because it has 曜日 in it. But what day of the week is it? The Sun day of the week is Sunday.

100219 | 易しい | やさしい | Easy | Simple To Do | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of easy?

You say things like "Hey, can you get me some water?" They say "yassah!" (やさ) very enthusiastically.
100220 | 布団 | ふとん | Futon | Bedding\n Sleeping Mat\n Duvet | Put some cloth in a group and you get a futon. It’s just the kind of nice, soft bedding or sleeping mat you’d like to curl up on.\nKeep in mind that this word is different from the English version. We’re not talking about sofa-beds for your dorm room here. In Japanese, your 布団 is the traditional bedding you lay out on the floor at night and put away in the daytime. 布団 can refer to the sleeping mat, the duvet that covers it, or both items as a set. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The reading for 団 is the secondary reading that went with the kanji, though, so watch out for that. If you can figure out the meaning of this word, chances are you already know how to spell it, so carry that over to Japanese.
100221 | 財布 | さいふ | Wallet | Purse | Your wealth cloth is your wallet. Really, a wallet is just a piece of cloth you keep in your pocket that has your wealth in it, right? This can also be your purse, especially if you live in the ol' UK. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

Also thick.\nThis is a relatively formal word that is generally used in writing. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. No thick books needed to understand this reading, yeah?
100225 | 妻 | つま | Wife | My Wife | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is used to refer to your own wife, though, for the most part. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Your wife does everything for you. She feeds you, she bathes you, she cleans up after you and even wipes your butt when you poop. Really, she is doing too much (つま), and you should stop being a baby.
100226 | 地価 | ちか | Land Value |  | The ground's value is the land value. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100227 | 素敵 | すてき | Lovely | Dreamy\n Beautiful | The element of enemy isn't something you should think of as bad.

Doesn't work as well with girls. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 素 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nOh wow, you look really lovely in that suit (す). Yes, I can see you through the Internet, and I have to say, that suit is just dreamy! Don't ever take it off.
100228 | 位置 | いち | Position | Location\n Place | Go ahead and put a rank on something. This one is rank #1, so its position is up higher. Then you put a rank #67 on something.

100229 | お土産 | おみやげ | Souvenir | Present | Are you visiting a neat place? Grab some dirt and bring it back with you. Then pretend to give birth to it in front of your friends. That dirt is now a special souvenir! It's the best present you could ever give someone! \n These readings are exceptions, sorry! Here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhen someone asks you who gave you a souvenir, just say "Miya gave (みやげ) it to me." Who's Miya? No idea. But neither do they. You never have to remember who gave you anything ever again! Miya gave you everything you own. She's probably a great person.
100230 | お手洗い | おてあらい | Toilet | Restroom\n Bathroom\n Lavatory | You know that 手洗い is "handwashing" (and also a not as polite way to mention a bathroom). When you add お you're suddenly making it polite. Why? Because you're talking about something a little more crass than handwashing. You're talking about the toilet or restroom or bathroom. Ewww. Poop goes there. \n The reading comes from 手洗い, so if you know that you'll know this too!
100231 | 弁護士 | べんごし | Attorney | Lawyer | A samurai who uses speech to defend people. This samurai does their battle in the court of law. This "samurai" is an attorney or a lawyer. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100232 | 本棚 | ほんだな | Bookcase | Bookshelf | A book shelf is a bookcase or bookshelf. \n The readings are the ones you learned with the individual kanji. Be careful of the rendaku.
100233 | 新幹線 | しんかんせん | Bullet Train | Shinkansen | This is one of those words that makes more sense when you look at the reading first. Technically this is the "New Tree Trunk Line" but you wouldn't realize this is the Japanese bullet train aka Shinkansen from that, would you? Maybe going to the reading will help you after all. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Read this to be able to remember the meaning, too, which is Shinkansen.
100234 | 優しい | やさしい | Gentle | Kind\n Warm Hearted\n Nice | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of gentle? It's gentle (but also kind or warm hearted). \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What do people who are gentle and kind say when someone asks of them a favor? Always "yessir" (やさ). Always, always "yessir"!
100235 | 看護師 | かんごし | Nurse |  | An expert who watches over and defends people at all hours is the nurse. That's what nurses do, 24/7. They have to check up on people, defend their health, and watch over them, making sure they're okay. What a tough job. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100236 | 張る | はる | To Stretch Over Something | To Spread Out\n To Swell\n To Be Taut | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means stretch, and the verb version means to stretch over something, to spread out, or to be taut, not to be confused with the type of stretching you do after a workout.\nThis word is both transitive and intransitive. When it follows を, it emphasizes the physical act of extending something over an area, like stretching a canvas over a frame, unfurling a sail on a ship, or roping off a crime scene. When following が, it expresses the resulting state of having been stretched or spread, like a bloated stomach, a swollen muscle, or a spider web. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nImagine yourself trying to stretch your favorite toy figurine, seeing just how far you can stretch it. With every stretch, you start laughing uncontrollably, HA (は) HA HA HA HA HA. Seems a bit cruel. Are you okay?
100237 | 建物 | たてもの | Building | Structure | This is a build thing, or perhaps a building thing. In other words, a building or structure.\n建物 is a very general word that can refer to any kind of building, including residential buildings, commercial buildings, or public facilities. \n The reading might look a little strange, but makes sense once you get it. You already know that the verb 建てる means "to build", and that a もの is a "thing". Now just remove the る part from the verb to make it a noun, combine it with もの, and we get たてもの! Just remember that it’s all kun’yomi since it comes from the verb 建てる.
100238 | 子供 | こども | Child | Kid\n Children\n Kids | A child servant is a child. Children are basically like little servants anyways, what else are they good for? \n The readings for this one are the kun'yomi readings of each kanji. 子 is just こ, like the individual vocab word. 供 is ども, however. Remember this by thinking how much children love domo-kun.\nAlso, 子ども is kind of more "politically correct" with the kana hanging off there. 子供 is still used in a lot of situations, usually stiff ones. The second kanji means servant, and some people don't like that. The second version pops up a decent amount, so it's good to be familiar with that as well.
100239 | 狭い | せまい | Narrow |  | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of narrow? It's narrow. \n The reading is the same as the kanji, so you're good to go here. It may be a narrow way of thinking about this kanji, but it will help you out the most.
100240 | 独り | ひとり | Alone | Solitude\n Single | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nWhile 一人 simply means "one person," 独り carries a stronger sense of being alone, often with connotations of solitude. It can also mean someone is single (as in not married). \n The reading is different from the one you learned (this is kun'yomi). There's an easy way to remember it, though. 一人 and 独り share the same readings and mean almost the same thing. Just try to remember that this ひとり is used to emphasize solitude.
100241 | 怪談 | かいだん | Ghost Story | Horror Story | If you have a suspicious talk, you're talking about something that may or may not be real. One of those things you could be discussing is a ghost story. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100242 | お菓子 | おかし | Snack Foods | Candy\n Pastries\n Sweets | Cake is a child's favorite snack food. This word refers to all the junkie snacks you can imagine, candy, pastries and sweets, but also savory snacks too. You know, like chips and stuff... 🤤 \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100243 | 自販機 | じはんき | Vending Machine |  | Remember the super long vending machine that is 自動販売機? This is a shorter easier to remember and say version. Basically every other kanji is removed, making it 自販機. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will also help if you know 自動販売機 already.
100244 | 居間 | いま | Living Room | Sitting Room | A room that comes alive in intervals is your living room, or sitting room. You don't spend all your time in there, so it can only be alive sometimes.\nNote that 居間 is a little old-fashioned. These days, the more common word for a living room is リビングルーム. \n The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own.
100245 | 靴 | くつ | Shoes |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. Huzzah!
100246 | 階段 | かいだん | Stairs | Stairway | The floor that makes up the steps are the stairs. Don't get this confused with the similar word 段階, which is the stairs making up the floors to a certain stage. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100247 | 綺麗 | きれい | Pretty | Beautiful\n Clean | Things that are beautiful and lovely are very beautiful, pretty, and often clean, too. You can call someone 綺麗. You can also mention how clean something is with 綺麗. Gives you some insight as to what "beauty" is in Japan, I suppose. Take your baths, folks.\nWondering what the difference is between 綺麗 and 美しい? 美しい is more dramatic, so it implies you’re really blown away by something’s (or someone’s) beauty. 綺麗, on the other hand, is a more everyday word that covers anything that’s beautiful, pretty, or even just clean. In other words, the bar is a bit lower for 綺麗! \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100248 | 傘 | かさ | Umbrella |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji.
100249 | 娘 | むすめ | Daughter |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji.
100250 | 韓国 | かんこく | South Korea | Korea | The Korea Country is Korea, of course... well, South Korea that is. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100251 | 切符 | きっぷ | Ticket |  | A cut token is a token you cut out from a sheet of paper into smaller sheets, and each of these pieces is a ticket. \n The reading is 切る cut short to きっ, then ふ rendaku'd to ぷ. It's a bit of a troublesome word, so concentrate on this now a bit so you can get it in the reviews.
100252 | 救急車 | きゅうきゅうしゃ | Ambulance |  | Rescue in a hurry using this car. What kinds of cars can do this? How about an ambulance. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
100253 | 掃除 | そうじ | Cleaning |  | Sweep and exclude all that dirt from the floor, please. When you do this a lot, it becomes cleaning. \n This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. For this one though, you have to remember to read the 除 part as じ. Just keep in mind that cleaning (cleanliness) is next to godliness and so is Jesus (じ). So, Jesus is like cleaning. Easy.
100254 | 幾ら | いくら | How Much |  | This has the same meaning as the kanji, specifically the how much meaning. To remember this, just think about how Ra, the Egyptian God, is always asking "How much will it cost to build this pyramid?" Ugh, too much, let's hire some slaves. \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already so you should be able to read it!
100255 | 富士山 | ふじさん | Mt Fuji | Mount Fuji | Did you know that the mountain that is rich in samurai happens to be Japan's most famous mountain? It makes sense considering samurai are probably Japan's most famous thing as well. Combine the two most famous things and you have Mt Fuji (or Mount Fuji if you'd rather write it that way). \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100256 | 机 | つくえ | Desk |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji.
100257 | 暖かい | あたたかい | Warm | Mild | This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of warm? It's warm as well! Though this is for a warm weather or temperature, not some warm food or something like that, that would be 温かい, a different あたたかい. Confusing, right? \n The reading is the same as 温かい, which also means warm. But while that 温かい refers to a warm thing, this 暖かい refers to a warm temperature or place.\nJust like with 温かい, people often pronounce this as あったかい in conversation. But when it comes to kanji exams or typing out the kanji, remember to use あたたかい!

100259 | 園 | その | Garden |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\nThis word is generally used in the names of gardens, like エデンの園 and 桜の園. It's also used in phrases like 学びの園, which means "school" and carries the connotation of being a haven for learning. \n This word uses the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhich garden is the Garden of Eden? その garden! That garden right next to you is the Garden of Eden!\nIt can also use the on'yomi, though, which you've already learned. When it takes the on'yomi and is used as a standalone word, it usually refers to some kind of institution, like a 幼稚園.
100260 | 肺 | はい | Lung |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. OH HAI THERE LUNG. OH HAI THERE YOU.
100261 | 雑誌 | ざっし | Magazine |  | Random magazine is pretty much all magazines. Just a bunch of random stuff inside, making it a magazine. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100262 | 冷蔵庫 | れいぞうこ | Refrigerator | Fridge | A cool storehouse storage is a place you put things (like food) to keep them cool. This is a refrigerator. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100263 | 掃除機 | そうじき | Vacuum Cleaner |  | A cleaning (掃除) machine is a vacuum cleaner. Suck that dirt up! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100264 | 紅茶 | こうちゃ | Black Tea |  | A deep red tea isn't a deep red tea... it's a black tea. If you think about it, a lot of black tea is really deep red, which is why a deep red tea is a black tea instead. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100265 | 咳 | せき | Cough |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading for this vocabulary is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji.
100266 | 講演 | こうえん | Lecture | Address | Perform your lecture. This is your lecture. This is your address to the people. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100267 | 寿司 | すし | Sushi |  | The lifespan of a director depends on how much sushi they eat.\nOkay, the kanji in 寿司 aren't actually related to the meaning of the word, so this one's kind of tricky. Just try to think of sushi as the secret to a long lifespan for directors. Imagine all those directors wolfing down a bunch of sushi because they're desperate to lengthen their lifespans. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.\nIt might also help to know the kanji in 寿司 are 当て字 (remember those?). They have nothing to do with sushi, so they're just being used here for their sound.
100268 | 味噌汁 | みそしる | Miso Soup |  | You know that 味噌 is "miso," and that 汁 is "soup." So, combine them together and you have Miso Soup. \n The reading is 味噌 plus the vocab 汁 put together.
100269 | 台湾 | たいわん | Taiwan |  | The machine gulf isn't what you'd expect. In fact, looking at the reading will probably help the most first, since this word represents Taiwan. \n The reading is たい for 台, which is a little different from what you learned, but not the end of the world (especially if you can get the meaning down). The わん is however what you learned, so even if you arrive to だいわん, you'll probably realize that this is たいわん.
100270 | 選択 | せんたく | Selection | Choice | Choose and select your choice. This is your selection. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100271 | 御飯 | ごはん | Cooked Rice | Meal | The honorable meal is cooked rice. It's the meal of Japan. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

100273 | 勧告 | かんこく | Recommendation | Official Advice | If you take what you recommend and announce it to the world, you are making a recommendation. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
100274 | 〜殿 | どの | Mr. | Ms.\n Lord | The kanji means Milord, and this word used to be a name ender similar to the English title Lord, but nowadays it's closer to Mr. or Ms.. It's rarely used in speaking or even written correspondence these days, but is still used in official documents, and you'll probably see it most on certificates. If in doubt, you're better off choosing the name ender 様 because it's much more widely used, and also more polite than 殿. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember:\nDo you know a Lord? Imagine it being someone named Mr. or Ms. Don (どの). If you know a Don, that's great, imagine that person. If you don't, think of a famous Don that's out there.
100275 | 吹く | ふく | To Blow |  | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means blow so the verb vocab version is to blow. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
100276 | 蜂 | はち | Bee | Hornet\n Wasp | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
100277 | 御手洗 | おてあらい | Restroom | Bathroom\n Toilet | You know 手洗い, right? This is like that, but way more polite sounding. The meaning is still the same though: restroom, bathroom, toilet. \n The reading for the 御 is お, the rest is てあらい, even though the い isn't showing on the end. It gets pushed into the 洗い.
100278 | 範 | はん | Example | Model | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned as well!
100279 | 喪 | も | Mourning |  | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. \n Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:\nWhat's the first two letters of the word mourning? It's mo (も). You can use that to remember.
100280 | 慰謝 | いしゃ | Consolation |  | I show my consolation by apologizing. This is consolation. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

100282 | 柔道 | じゅうどう | Judo | Juudou | The gentle path is, surprisingly, judo. Yep, the sport / art based on throwing people around. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

100285 | 曇り | くもり | Cloudy Weather | Cloudiness\n Fog | The noun version of cloudy is cloudy weather or cloudiness. In some cases, this can also refer to the type of fog you'd find on a window or your glasses.\nDespite being a noun in Japanese, you'll actually see this translated as the adjective "cloudy" in English a lot. Don't let that fool you, though, it still behaves as a noun in Japanese! It's just another example of word types not quite matching up between English and Japanese. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
100286 | 椅子 | いす | Chair |  | A chair child is for some reason just a chair. Not sure why it's a child, but it is. \n The reading for 子 is weird. It's す, so think about how you sat on this chair and it broke, so you sued (す) the person who made the chair (who happened to be a child).

100293 | 貼る | はる | To Paste | To Stick | Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means paste so the verb vocab is to paste (or to stick). \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
100294 | 〜妃 | ひ | Princess | Queen | The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.\n〜妃  essentially refers to the wife of a crown prince, emperor, or other royal family member. So depending on the context, it can mean princess or queen. \n The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
100295 | 誓い | ちかい | Vow | Oath | This looks like an adjective, but it's actually a noun. This word is the same as the kanji meaning: vow (or oath). \n This has the same reading as 近い (ちかい).

100299 | 洗濯機 | せんたくき | Washing Machine | Laundry Machine | A wash wash machine is just another way of saying washing machine. It does extra washing that you can't do by hand so there are two washes here. \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.\nNote that although せんたくき is the official reading, this word is commonly pronounced せんたっき when spoken.
100300 | お風呂 | おふろ | Bath |  | Let the wind in from the window above your bath so the water is cool enough for you to take a bath! If the water is too hot, you'll get all dizzy and that's dangerous! \n This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. This isn't the same on'yomi reading you learned for 風, though. It's a little different: ふ. If you're taking a bath you'd be a fool (ふ) to bring food in there. Drop the う or you'll end up as soup!

It's annoying! \n Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.
